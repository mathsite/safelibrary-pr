<h3>
CHAPTER I
<br><br>
INTRODUCTION TO STORM
</h3>

<p>
Probably Susan Hawthorne got a lot of her courage and
independence from her father, old Smiler Hawthorne, who
in his time had been nearly everything and nearly
everywhere—a tall, grizzled man who was generally broke but
always unbeatable.  Anyway, wherever she got it from, she
needed it all; for old Hawthorne crossed the Divide one
night with the same reckless optimism as he had gone
through life.  He left her his name and thirty pounds, the
rest of his fortune having disappeared only a week before,
together with the promoter of a company whose sole asset
was a diamond field wherein no diamonds were.
</p>

<p>
And Susan Hawthorne faced a blank future with a
smile that was reminiscent of old Smiler's cheeriest effort,
which you only saw when things were very black and the
proposition to be tackled was exceeding tough.  He was that
sort of man, and she was his daughter.
</p>

<p>
She felt very much alone in the world.  She had lost touch
with her own friends in the accompanying of her father in
his happy-go-lucky aimless globe-trotting; and most of the
friends he had picked up himself—and they were legion—were
scattered in odd corners of the earth.  In any case, she
was not one to look for charity.  Wherefore she went to
Lord Hannassay, because he seemed to be the only friend
of her father's who was in England.
</p>

<p>
She went with some trepidation, and was not
unpleasantly surprised, and more than a little nervous, when she
found that he was not so inaccessible as his name and
position seemed to indicate.
</p>

<p>
"I remember you—sixteen, weren't you?—queer kid—all
eyes and legs.  And your father?"
</p>

<p>
He had a curiously disjointed manner of speaking, conveying
the impression that his thoughts moved faster than
his mouth could frame them.
</p>

<p>
"My father died a month ago," she said.
</p>

<p>
His grim face softened for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," he said quietly.  "Your father was one
of the few men I have ever really liked."
</p>

<p>
After a while she broached the subject of her visit.  It was
not a task she relished, for she was desperately afraid he
would misunderstand.
</p>

<p>
His face remained inscrutable, but the blue eyes searched
her face.
</p>

<p>
The fingers of his right hand drummed on the table.  She
learnt afterwards that this was a trick of his when he was
embarrassed.
</p>

<p>
"What can you do?" he asked.
"Shorthand—book-keeping—type-writing—anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, I'm afraid."  She had realised all along the
hopeless inadequacy of her qualifications, and felt
unnecessarily small and foolish.  "But I could learn."
</p>

<p>
"There are hundreds of girls who have learnt—still looking
for jobs," he said.  His finger-tips played an intricate
tattoo.  "Listen—you're afraid I'll offer you money.  Feel
insulted if I do—probably walk out in a rage.  Still, I wish
you'd let me.  I've got heaps.  I like money—I'd like more—and
I don't often give it away.  But you're different.
I'd have done it for your father, any day—why not for
you?"
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough, she was not annoyed.  His nervousness
was so amusing.  He was obviously as scared of making a
<i>faux pas</i> as she was of his making one, and he didn't know
how to do it without seeming to.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry," she said.  "I'm looking for work, not outdoor
relief."
</p>

<p>
"I know all about that," he said peevishly.  "You wouldn't
have minded taking it from your father."
</p>

<p>
"That's different," she said, and he was not foolish
enough to attempt to argue the point further.
</p>

<p>
He turned over some papers, picked up a pencil, and
played with it.  There was an unusual quality about these
little mannerisms of his: they were never jerky and
inconsequent, like the fidgeting of a different kind of man.  He
seemed to employ material objects to assist his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"I want a typist," he said at length.  "You can get reasonably
proficient in a fortnight if you work hard.  No need for
much speed, anyhow—no dictation.  Copying letters,
etcetera.  You can have the job if you'll be my guest here
while you're learning.  That's not charity—you'd accept
an invitation like that even if you weren't broke.  Use the
house how you like—I'm going to Geneva.  League of Nations
conferences—all rot.  However ... housekeeper's always
here.  Your reputation's all right.  But while I'm away—no
wild parties, mind!"
</p>

<p>
He issued the order with such a comical seriousness that
she all but laughed aloud.
</p>

<p>
"I'll try to reform," she promised gravely.
</p>

<p>
The time passed quickly for her.  The work was easy and
interesting, the hours short.  Once or twice it occurred to
her that her job was simply a disguise for the charity she
dreaded, but her hint of this suspicion was received with
such pained surprise that, not unwillingly, she banished
the idea.  Hannassay came and went, always courteous and
correct.  She grew to like him, for he thought she detected
the sentimentalist masquerading in self-defence as the
tyrant.
</p>

<p>
After a month she began to consider herself an authority
on affairs of State, for Lord Hannassay held a high post
in the Home Office.  It took her nearly three months more
to realise that she knew practically nothing.
</p>

<p>
She was returning from the Home Office one afternoon
after delivering some papers when she discovered that she
was not as friendless as she had thought, and the discovery
was a cheerful surprise.  She was walking back along
Piccadilly when she nearly collided with a tall young man in a
grey flannel suit.
</p>

<p>
He raised his hat absently, apologised, and was about to
pass on when suddenly they stopped dead and stared at one
another.
</p>

<p>
"Je-rusalem!" exclaimed the young man.
</p>

<p>
He linked his arm in hers in the most natural way in the
world, and steered her out of the press towards the portals
of the Leroy.
</p>

<p>
"It's just four," he remarked, "and therefore tea-time.
I've not seen you for years, Susan—millions of years!"
</p>

<p>
They found a table and sat down on either side of it,
inspecting one another.  Then they both smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Christopher Arden," she said, "you'll do!"
</p>

<p>
"And you, by Jeremy!  Susan, what do you mean by it?
I've written you regularly for the last three years, and you
haven't answered a line."
</p>

<p>
"I might have," she answered demurely, "if you'd put
your address on your letters."
</p>

<p>
His jaw dropped.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!"  She smiled.  "You put 'Morocco' and 'South
Pacific' and 'Nassau' and that sort of thing.  Only I didn't
think you were notorious enough for that alone to find
you."
</p>

<p>
He grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry!" he apologised.  "Tell me all about this and
that."
</p>

<p>
She told him, and his brown hand went across the table
and touched her fingers lightly.
</p>

<p>
He said nothing—that wouldn't have been Kit Arden,
known as Storm wherever soldiers of fortune were gathered
together.  He hadn't altered.  He had always had a manner
which mocked the expression of words; and yet his
unspoken sympathy meant more to the girl than any amount
of fluent condolences.  She found his old irresistible spell,
that had captured her imagination even when he was a dashing
youngster of twenty-four and she a girl of seventeen,
as potent as it had always been.
</p>

<p>
Physically he was the same as ever, save that his fair
hair had oddly greyed a little at the temples—a curious
contrast to the unlined boyishness of his face.  But that was the
keynote of his appearance, those contrasts.  His slim yet
broad-shouldered figure, the forceful mouth that could smile
with such an infectious gaiety, the square jaw and the
artist's hands, the Saxon hair and gun-metal grey eyes.  Storm,
who was Storm—so perfectly did the name fit him that it
was impossible to think of him as anything else—Storm,
the reckless, daredevil trouble-hunter with the heart of a
crusader....
</p>

<p>
"And where've you been?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, here and there," he said.  "I put in a bit of time with
the Riffi—they made me a Kaid or a Pasha or whatever a
Riff makes you when he loves you like a brother.  Then that
blew over, so I beat it to the Pacific and went pearling.  Had
a merry scrap with a Jap patrol, fishing on forbidden
ground.  That was nearly the end of my career!  Then that
got dull, so I toddled over to the Bahamas and set up as a
bootlegger.  Respectability's tame!  A short life and a beery
one—that's me!  And then you can bury me under the
foundation-stone of a brewery.  Stevenson's verse 'll do for my
epitaph—fine!  You know it?
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Here he lies where he longed to be,<br>
  Home is the bootlegger, home from the sea,<br>
      And the moonshiner home from the still..."<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"You haven't changed a bit," she laughed
</p>

<p>
"Nor you—you're just as lovely as ever—more so!  Your
eyes, now.  I love brown eyes——"
</p>

<p>
She stopped him with a solemnly upraised hand.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing now?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Divers things, and, on the whole, nothing much," he
said vaguely.  "London's paralytic!  I'm just wondering
whether it'd be worth while going back to Paluna—you
remember, I ran a one-man revolution there and made myself
President about three years back.  Being President of a
South American Republic is some game, believe uncle!"
</p>

<p>
He was, as a matter of fact, doing rather more than
divers things.  When he left he returned to Scotland Yard
and made his way to the office of the Assistant
Commissioner.
</p>

<p>
"You can take it from me, Bill," he informed that
gentleman, "that Hannassay's new typist's all right.  I've known
her for years—-her father took me out of the workhouse
and educated me.  Incidentally, he started me on my
adventurous career.  I tell you, anyone who was brought up by
Smiler Hawthorne and after that went in for stockbroking
or market gardening or anything else respectable and dull
would have been a blistering Robot!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to hear it," said Bill Kennedy drily.  "I'd
already gathered that you weren't a Robot, laddie, from the
fact that you took an hour and a half to find out about her when
you'd known her for years.  Now you can push off, because I
work sometimes.  See you later."
</p>

<p>
Storm went to his own room, and shortly after Inspector
Teal arrived to make his report.  "Well, Teal?" he prompted
briskly.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing," said Mr. Teal sleepily.  "The process of
reformation continues.  I looked up Lew Mecklen and Gat Morini
this morning, and they greeted me like a long-lost brother—which
isn't like Lew and the gentle Gat.  They've been over for a
month now, and they haven't made a joke yet.  Birdie Sands
has been out six weeks, and we haven't had a thing on him.
And Prester John hasn't cracked a crib for two months—and
I know he was hard up two months ago.  Mr. Arden, when a lot
of old lags all start reforming at once my nose itches!"
</p>

<p>
"Uh-huh," said Storm thoughtfully.  "And they're only a few."
</p>

<p>
"With more coming into the fold every day," supplemented
Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
He was a big slow-moving man, red-faced and sleepy-eyed,
beginning to pay the price of his youthful robustness as
muscle turned to fat and easy living irresistibly increased his
circumference.  He was invariably tired and invariably bored—it
was an affectation of his of which he was intensely proud.
</p>

<p>
Storm stared out of the window.
</p>

<p>
"When I got into this job," he said, "I had ideas.  I thought
Special Branch dealt with active crooks—not the boys who'd
turned good.  This is more subtle than I'd like it to be."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal said nothing.
</p>

<p>
Rousing himself slightly with what seemed a terrific
effort, he reached into a pocket and extracted a small packet
therefrom.  From this packet he removed a smaller packet, and
from the smaller packet he detached the pink wrapper.
</p>

<p>
"If it wasn't so absurd," said Storm, "I'd tell you the only
explanation I can see that fits."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal conveyed a wafer of chewing gum to his mouth
and champed meditatively.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Arden," he murmured drowsily, "if I hadn't heard
things that make me want to offer that same theory, I'd say it
was absurd.  But I stood Prester John a drink this afternoon, and
I picked his pocket.  I ought to have been a criminal really—people
wouldn't suspect me, because I look so innocent.  Anyway, I
found something interesting.  Look at this."
</p>

<p>
From his waistcoat pocket he took something that glittered
and laid it on Storm's desk.
</p>

<p>
It was a little silver triangle.  In the centre a similar
triangle was picked out in black enamel, and in the centre of
this a silver alpha had been picked out in the enamel.
</p>

<p>
Storm looked at it closely, turned it over and inspected
the back, and laid it down.
</p>

<p>
"What's this got to do with anything—if anything?" he
demanded, and Mr. Teal shook his head.  "That's what I want
to know."
</p>

<p>
The bell under Storm's desk rang discordantly, and he
picked up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo...  Speaking."
</p>

<p>
He listened for a moment, and then spoke insistently.
</p>

<p>
"Struth!  No, I don't know anything about it—yet.  Look
here, Mr. Blaythwayt, will you wrap that letter up exactly as
it came, envelope and all, and send it round at once by special
messenger? ... Yes, New Scotland Yard....  Right-thanks!"
</p>

<p>
"I know that man Blaythwayt," said Mr. Teal, as Storm
replaced the receiver.  "He's manager—"
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" snarled Storm.  "I'm thinking."
</p>

<p>
He swung over to the window and stood looking down
for some moments.  Then, abruptly, he came back to his
desk and pressed a bell.
</p>

<p>
To the man who answered the summons he gave the
trinket that Teal had brought him.
</p>

<p>
"Go down to Records," he commanded, "and ask 'em
for anything they've got in which anything like this figured."
</p>

<p>
It was only ten minutes before the man returned, bearing
with him a small bundle of papers.  Storm lighted a
cigarette and went through them carefully, and at the end
he looked steadily across at Inspector Teal.
</p>

<p>
"Listen," he said.  "Just over three months ago a man
was found dead by the railway between Priory and
Kearsney—that's on the Dover-London line.  There were no
marks of violence, and since he had a ticket from Dover
to Victoria it was supposed that he'd simply fallen out of
the train.  He was identified as Henri Francois Joubert, a
Frenchman domiciled in England, who'd made his fortune
on the Stock Exchange—jobbing, you know—about thirty
years ago.  There'd be no records of the case if it hadn't
been for one curious thing.  In one of his pockets was this!"
</p>

<p>
He tapped a photograph with his forefinger, and Mr. Teal
peered at it with his habitual indifference.
</p>

<p>
It was a picture of a visiting card.  In the centre had been
sketched a design similar to that on the silver triangle of
Prester John, and underneath was roughly scrawled,
"<i>February, 1899</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Blaythwayt," said Storm, "has just received
through the post a similar card, and all that's written under
the triangle is <i>Harchester</i>.  What do you know about
Harchester, Teal?"
</p>

<p>
"One of the biggest and best public schools," said
Mr. Teal.  "Joe Blaythwayt was educated there."
</p>

<p>
Storm leaned back in his chair and exhaled a thin streamer
of smoke.  Then he looked at Inspector Teal and smiled.
Storm's smile was the most attractive thing about him.  It
flickered about his lips for a moment as though he didn't
want to give it a chance, and then it broke out—irrepressibly
boyish.  It bubbled over with mischief.
</p>

<p>
Head back and a little to one side, eyes dancing, Storm
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Absurd be catlicked!" Storm said.  "Teal, this is going
to be Big!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
<br><br>
TITTLE-TATTLE OF MR. TEAL
</h3>

<p>
Inspector Teal was that unusual type of man who literally
takes both pride and pleasure in his employment.  Mr. Teal
loved talking shop, and would do so for hours on end
if he found a listener on whom his enthusiasm was not
wasted.
</p>

<p>
He was never off duty.  His leisure hours would always
find him sauntering round the preserves of other divisions,
listening to gossip in public houses and at coffee stalls,
entering queer and unregistered "clubs," and paying friendly
calls on eccentric gentlemen not unknown to the Records
Office.  Criminals, to him, were a race of children—interesting,
amusing, and completely human, but occasionally in
need of sharp correction.  And when necessity demanded
that they be chastised, he haled them to their punishment
without resentment.
</p>

<p>
It was his boast that he knew every bad man in London,
and he was probably right.
</p>

<p>
The morning following his discovery of the Alpha Triangle
(already, with that queer instinct for the dramatic
which few would have suspected beneath his prosaic exterior,
he spelt it with capital letters) Inspector Teal flowed—there
is no other word for his peculiar method of
locomotion—in the direction of Kensington, for on the
left-hand side of Church Street, behind a door over which hung
three golden orbs, lived Mr. Eddie—more commonly known
as "Snooper"—Brome.
</p>

<p>
He was a big, florid, shock-headed man with an alarming
taste in fancy waistcoats.  Also the reputation of being
a receiver of stolen goods.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal considered himself lucky to find him in residence,
for Snooper was a man of erratic habits and rarely
attended to his business in person.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Snooper," said Mr. Teal affably.
"How's trade?"
</p>

<p>
"Not too bad," said Snooper—trade, with him, was
always either "not too bad" or "not too good"—"Have a
cigar?"
</p>

<p>
The sample he offered was undoubtedly a weed of great
price, and Mr. Teal sniffed at it suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Who gave you this?" he asked, and Snooper shook his
head.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot," he said unhappily, "get rid of the idea that
you suspect me of being a receiver."
</p>

<p>
"You might have made a worse guess," said Mr. Teal.
"Quite easily.  How are the crooks?  Or is 'clients' the
correct term?  Comrades Lew and Gat are heading for trouble,
you know."
</p>

<p>
"Don't know 'em," said Eddie.
</p>

<p>
"Interesting people, very," said Mr. Teal.  "Especially
the educated Gat.  He has the most cherubic blue eyes.  You'd
love him."  He stirred in his chair sluggishly.  "By the way,
Snooper, there's a friend of mine I'd like to bring along
to meet you one day, if you'll let me know when you're at
home.  He's interested in criminals."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brome shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid my acquaintance with the criminal fraternity
won't help him.  Still," he admitted, "like all
pawn—er—financial agents, I have had
stolen property offered to me.
Naturally, I immediately notified the police."
</p>

<p>
"On two occasions," supplemented Mr. Teal.  "And the
total value of the stuff was exactly two pounds five shillings
and ten pence."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help that.  I wish it had been more," said Eddie
piously.
</p>

<p>
"I believe you," said Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
He glanced round the room, his heavy-lidded eyes taking
in afresh every familiar detail of unostentatious comfort—even
luxury.  There was no suggestion of wealth, but more
than a hint of solid well-being.  Looking merely at Snooper's
waistcoats, one would never have suspected their inhabitant
of possessing so artistically furnished a room.
</p>

<p>
"You do rather well out of pawn—er—financial agenting,"
remarked Teal absently, and went off at an abrupt
angle.  "Are you the philanthropist who's financing Birdie
Sands?"
</p>

<p>
"Birdie's hands?" inquired the puzzled Mr. Brome.
</p>

<p>
"Birdie Sands," Mr. Teal enunciated clearly and
distinctly.  "Strange as it may seem, I was once educated."
</p>

<p>
"I have met a <i>Mister</i> Sands.  Who's this 'Birdie' Sands?"
</p>

<p>
"A gentleman," said Mr. Teal, "who used to be on the
whizz."
</p>

<p>
"On <i>what</i>?" demanded the startled Snooper.
</p>

<p>
"A pickpocket," explained Mr. Teal patiently.  "Do you
know him?"
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Brome did not squawk derisively, his elevated
archidiaconal eyebrows rendered such a lamentable
exhibition unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
"A low criminal?" he protested.  "Now, I ask you, Mr. Teal,
is it likely?"
</p>

<p>
"Taking things all round, I should say it is.  Birdie
Sands," went on the detective, apparently for his own benefit,
"is, or was, the best whizzer operating in London.  He
was inside up—to about six weeks ago—that's about twice
the time you've been financial agenting, isn't it, by the way?
Since then we've had nothing on him, and he seems to have
all the money in the world."
</p>

<p>
"He may be going straight," suggested Eddie.
</p>

<p>
"Go straight?" jeered Teal drowsily.  "It's a physical
impossibility.  That man's a human corkscrew with all the
twists case-hardened.  He's a born crook—his mother was
a crook and all his fathers were crooks, and Birdie was
brought up as a crook, Borstal trained.  Why, if you shot
him out of a gun he'd tie knots in the barrel."
</p>

<p>
"What happened to the gun you were shot out of when
you got that face?" inquired Mr. Brome vulgarly, but
Inspector Teal failed to bite.
</p>

<p>
He heaved himself laboriously from his chair.
</p>

<p>
"I'm interested," he said, "because when a born-an'-bred
crook earns a lot of honest money, it just ain't natural.
I've got a nose for dirty work, and that same nose is
worrying me now.  When shall I bring my friend along?"
</p>

<p>
"Shall we say Sunday?" invited Mr. Brome.  "At eight?
Suit you?  Splendid.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
But he stopped Teal at the door.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you won't put any ideas into his head," he said
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal regarded him thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"What I'm afraid of," he replied, "is that he'll put ideas
into yours."
</p>

<p>
With that his projected programme was exhausted, but
he was destined to have an interesting morning.
</p>

<p>
On his way back to the Yard he dropped in at Walton
Street police station, near the Brompton Road, for a chat
with the divisional-inspector.  While he was there a lank,
saturnine man entered jauntily.
</p>

<p>
"James Mattock—convict on licence.  I've come to report."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal surged across (as I have said, one has
to use extraordinary words to convey his ponderous mode
of progression).
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Mattock," he said.  "When did you come out?"
</p>

<p>
"A fortnight ago."
</p>

<p>
Mattock's manner did not encourage further conversation,
but it took a lot to put off Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing now?"
</p>

<p>
The man's thin lips twisted.
</p>

<p>
"Working.  Do you want to get me the sack by telling
them my past record?" he sneered.  "Because if so, you're
too late.  I thought I'd get in with it before you busies got
a chance."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you picked up that word in Wandsworth,"
said Teal.  "Getting the slang already—a pity.  Who are
'them'?"
</p>

<p>
"Raegenssen's.  I'm head clerk and in practice
semi-manager.  They haven't got much of a staff."
</p>

<p>
"That's a pity, too," murmured Mr. Teal.  "Temptation
never did anybody any good; and you weren't built for a
crook, Mattock."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad of that," said Mattock, surveying Mr. Teal's
girth pointedly.
</p>

<p>
Teal fingered his chin, his eyes on the other man's face.
It was a refined face, lined bitterly.  The man was
educated—Teal knew that, for he himself had arrested Mattock for
his first and only crime.  Teal also knew what the court that
sentenced Mattock for forgery never knew—why the crime
was committed.
</p>

<p>
"Let's see," mused Teal.  "Hannassay put you away."
</p>

<p>
"That's true."
</p>

<p>
"A cheque—you were his private secretary, weren't you?
And he saw to it you got the full stretch—not even a first
offender's chance.  That's right, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"It is."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal's contemplative fingering of his chin continued.
He would have been better pleased if Mattock had
been stung to a storm of abuse and threats, for the only
dangerous criminal is the one who hugs his grievances.
</p>

<p>
"You don't love him much, do you?"
</p>

<p>
"Would you?" countered the other.
</p>

<p>
"Possibly not," admitted Mr. Teal.  "Did they ever
recover the money you drew on that cheque?  Six thousand,
wasn't it?  You must have a tidy bit put away—why go
clerking?  Or did Joan throw you over?"
</p>

<p>
"That's my business," said Mattock icily.  "What exactly
are you trying to do, Teal—rub in my disgrace, or
persuade me to commit another crime so that you can make
me a thorough old lag?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal shrugged.  His sleepy eyes were nearly closed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry you're such a fool, Mattock," he drawled.
"What I'm trying to do is to save you from making an utter
mess of the rest of your life."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Mattock curtly.  "And now do you mind
going and preaching to someone else?"
</p>

<p>
"I will," promised Mr. Teal.  "Come along and have
lunch, Mattock, and let's talk things over."
</p>

<p>
He rolled in to report progress to Storm later, and told
of an unsatisfactory conversation.
</p>

<p>
"He thawed after a bit, but since he was liquid air to
start with he wasn't much better than an iceberg even then.
A card—he was a gentleman all right, once, and still talks
like one.  One of the Somerset Mattocks—they had pots of
money once, and then went bust.  Mattock fell in with
Joan Sands, Birdie's sister.  She got very ill.  The docs. said
the only way to save her life was to operate and then send
her to the south of France for a long rest.  Mattock couldn't
pay, and Birdie was in stir and never had much money
anyway.  He was defiant and insolent in court, otherwise he
might have got off a bit lighter, in spite of all the fuss
Hannassay kicked up at the time about making examples
and so on.  He's the hottest man in the country on crooks,
and they all hate him like a pussyfoot hates beer.  My own
idea is that Mattock begged Hannassay to help him out and
was turned down.  Hannassay's as hard as tungsten, in any
case."
</p>

<p>
"What about Snooper?" asked Storm.
</p>

<p>
Teal flicked his chewing gum through the window and
replaced it with a fresh slab.
</p>

<p>
"The flavour <i>doesn't</i> last," he remarked with irrelevant
irritation.  "Oh, Snooper.  We don't know much about him—he's
a success so far.  We don't even know where he lives.
We had him shadowed once, to find out, and he spotted the
tail and came storming in here swearing he'd bring a suit
against us if it happened again.  He'd have won his case,
too—we can't tail people unless we've got anything definite to
justify it.  He's only been in business for about three months,
and as far as anyone can prove he's as innocent as the
day.  What I <i>know</i> 's another matter—and that is that in
three months he's become the first fence in London."
</p>

<p>
Storm nodded and pulled out a drawer, from which he
took an envelope.
</p>

<p>
"Some more souvenirs have come in," he said.
</p>

<p>
One by one he spread out three small white caras on the
desk.  Each bore the same symbol in the centre, but the
inscriptions differed.
</p>

<p>
One said simply, "<i>Harchester</i>."
</p>

<p>
"That's your pal Blaythwayt's."
</p>

<p>
On the second was written, "<i>March 23rd, 1897</i>."
</p>

<p>
"That was received this morning by the Home Secretary,
Sir John Marker," said Storm.
</p>

<p>
The third similarly bore a date: "<i>December 2nd, 1899</i>."
</p>

<p>
"That one went to John Cardan, editor of the <i>Record</i>."
Storm's faint smile played about his lips.  "What do you
make of it, Teal?"
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Give me time, sir," he murmured.  "A French-English
stock-jobber, a bank manager, a Cabinet Minister, and a
newspaper editor.  And just dates, except one which has the
name of a place.  Where were they posted?"
</p>

<p>
"In different parts of London.  There's not even a threat,
you notice.  Just dates and places, which obviously mean
something to the man who sent 'em, and may mean something
to the men who got 'em.  I want you to push off on that
trail for the moment, Teal.  It mayn't lead anywhere, but it
may.  Find out what happened to Marker on March 23rd,
1897, anything important that happened to Blaythwayt at
Harchester, and anything Cardan can remember about
December 2nd, 1899."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal sighed.
</p>

<p>
"That sounds like a lifer to me," he groaned, and picked
up his hat wearily.
</p>

<p>
He concluded an unproductive round of investigations by
spending the evening at a house in the Finchley Road, where
dwelt Joe Blaythwayt, manager of the Lombard Street
branch of the City and Continental Bank.
</p>

<p>
Joe Blaythwayt was nearly as rotund as himself, but
shorter by six inches.  And, whereas Mr. Teal's eyes always
seemed to be struggling with an overpowering desire for
sleep, Blaythwayt's were always alert and twinkling.
</p>

<p>
These evenings, during which they played piquet and discussed
crime and criminals, detectives and detection (these
are four different subjects) were among the relaxations of
Mr. Teal's life.  Joe Blaythwayt had a crimson taste in
fiction, and absorbed Mr. Teal's practical knowledge eagerly.
</p>

<p>
It is, of course, unusual for a policeman to be the especial
friend of a bank manager; but then, Inspector Teal's
friends were a queerly mixed crowd.
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt was reading a novel with a distinctly intriguing
cover, but he put it away on Teal's arrival.
</p>

<p>
"That book," he said, jerking a disgusted thumb in the
direction of the offending volume, "that book is supposed
to deal with the exploits of a master criminal, and already
he's made four mistakes which even a policeman couldn't
miss."
</p>

<p>
Teal grinned languidly and took his usual chair.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better write a book yourself and show 'em how
to do it."
</p>

<p>
"I've started!" announced Joe.  "Two minds, etcetera.
It'll be the greatest detective story ever written.  Everyone
will buy it."
</p>

<p>
"Will anybody publish it?" inquired the practical Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
"How do you get a book published?" asked Blaythwayt.
</p>

<p>
"Send it to a publisher and enclose enough stamps to pay
for him sending it back," pronounced the detective, and
Joe's round face lengthened as he visualised the sordid
difficulties of a literary career.
</p>

<p>
But he soon brightened up.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be great," he enthused.  "I'm writing it in the first
person, and I shall commit impossible crimes.  I shall never
be caught."
</p>

<p>
"Let's hope not," grunted Teal.  "I'd hate having to
arrest you.  Besides, crooks are only romantic characters in
fiction."
</p>

<p>
"It'll be in the form of a diary, and——"
</p>

<p>
"Where are the cards?" asked Mr. Teal slumbrously.
</p>

<p>
During the intervals of the game, he recounted his
experiences of the day, for Blaythwayt was a great student of
contemporary crime.  Also, he delighted his friend by telling
him that a real live criminal had consented to be at home
when they called.
</p>

<p>
"I think you must peeve Snooper," said Blaythwayt.
"You do try the magazine detective stunt—trying to make
people think you know everything."
</p>

<p>
"Nearly everything," corrected Teal modestly.
</p>

<p>
"If you know everything you know nearly everything,"
said Joe sententiously, and Mr. Teal stared at him.
</p>

<p>
"You've been going to one of these modern plays," he
accused.
</p>

<p>
"I've been studying the stage with a view to dramatising
my book.  That sort of thing goes well.  Look at <i>Raffles</i>."
</p>

<p>
"You didn't write <i>Raffles</i>," said Mr. Teal crushingly.
</p>

<p>
They played out two more hands in silence, and then
Blaythwayt looked up brightly.
</p>

<p>
"At least," he said, "I can stump you."
</p>

<p>
"Carry on," suggested Teal.
</p>

<p>
"Who is Christopher Arden?"
</p>

<p>
"My chief, <i>pro tem</i>.  He got into Special Branch through
the Assistant Commissioner, and he's all right—you can
take that from me.  He's one of these tough young soldiers
of fortune.  He'll never settle down.  He joined up in the
ranks at sixteen, and came out at the end of the war a
captain.  Ever met him?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"You'd like him.  He's big, and strong as they're made.
He talks like a quick-firing gun, and he's got a nerve that'd
make a refrigerator look like a quiet corner in hell.  He's
one of these cool, casual devils who could get on to a bus
politely during the rush hour—and get on first!"
</p>

<p>
"That's off the point," said Blaythwayt, "I know all that.
You've told me about him once before.  I didn't ask <i>what</i> he
is, but <i>who</i> he is."
</p>

<p>
"Christopher Arden," said Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt smiled triumphantly.
</p>

<p>
"That stumped you!  I came across it quite by accident,
and if you hadn't mentioned the name I shouldn't have
done anything about it.  I scented a coincidence and I got
one.  Someone took him out of a workhouse at the age of
two, but who put him in?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll buy it," said Teal.
</p>

<p>
"He's got a good bit of money, too, hasn't he?  Well, he
may have picked up a bit on his travels—according to you,
he's tackled a few risky and paying jobs—but you can't go
pearling or bootlegging or running revolutions without
capital."
</p>

<p>
"I know that one," murmured the somnambulous Teal.
"An uncle died and left him ten thousand.  The solicitors
traced him somehow."
</p>

<p>
"What was the name of the uncle?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, and it isn't my business," said Teal
bluntly.  "If Kennedy says a man's all right, he is all right.
What are you getting at, Joe?"
</p>

<p>
"You ought to play about a bit in Somerset House,"
said Blaythwayt.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal blinked.  It was the only evidence he gave that
he was interested.
</p>

<p>
On his way home to his modest lodging near Victoria he
dropped in at the Albany to report his discoveries, such as
they were.  He found Storm arrayed in a suit of wonderfully
jazzed silk pyjamas and a staggering silk dressing-gown,
seated in a comfortable armchair in front of the
open window, his bare feet propped up on the sill and a slim
volume of Kipling On his knees.
</p>

<p>
"What news, Teal?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal pulled up a chair and accepted the proffered
cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Very little," he confessed.  "Joe Blaythwayt says he
never made an enemy at Harchester—in fact, he was very
popular.  Harchester's a great Rugger school, and Joe used
to be a star three-quarter before he put on weight.  Cardan
can't remember a thing.  Marker's the only man who could
remember anything at all, and all he knew was that in
March, 1897—he can't swear to the exact date—he got into
Parliament at the Clayston bye-election, and got married
a week later on the strength of it."
</p>

<p>
"It isn't much to go on," Storm admitted ruefully.  "I'll
talk to Marker to-morrow.  I suppose we can look up who
opposed him at Clayston, though I don't suppose there's
much in that.  Now look here."
</p>

<p>
He reached out for an envelope that lay on the table beside
him, and from it he drew a card which he laid in Teal's
hand.
</p>

<p>
"That came round from the Yard after dinner.  Raegenssen
brought it in—got it this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
The card and the sketch were by this time familiar to
Mr. Teal.  Underneath was the legend, "<i>April 1st, 1928</i>."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"There's been a mistake," he said.  "That one ought to
have come to me.  April the First is my birthday!"

<h3>
CHAPTER III
<br><br>
ADVANTAGES OF RESPECTABILITY
</h3>

<p>
Snooper Brome was not a man who was noted for his
love of fresh air and exercise.  In fact, none of his clients
had ever seen him except in the small, comfortable room
in Church Street, where he transacted business with the
favoured few who were privileged to deal with him
personally.  He came and went secretly, and discouraged
interest in his movements.
</p>

<p>
On this particular day, however, there was no furtiveness
about him.  He sauntered slowly through Kensington
Gardens, an exceptionally brilliant waistcoat proclaiming
his approach several hundred yards in advance of his
person, emerged into Exhibition Road, and strolled on down
that wide, barren thoroughfare.  At least one man followed
his progress, and Snooper permitted himself to smile
faintly.
</p>

<p>
On your right-hand side as you walk down from the
Park is a tube subway which leads to South Kensington
Station.  Into this wandered Mr. Brome, continued about
fifty yards, and stopped to light a cigar—a process which
took him some time.
</p>

<p>
Satisfied at last that anyone who was interested in his
destination had hurried onto the station by the overground
route to pick him up again as he left the tunnel, Mr. Brome
turned about, left the subway where he had entered it,
buttoned his coat over his fancy waistcoat, and made his way
briskly into Queen's Gate.  Just before he reached the
entrance of a block of flats he stopped to relight his cigar, and
took the opportunity of glancing keenly up and down the
road.
</p>

<p>
Joan Sands was curled up on a sofa reading when he
rang the bell, and she was not pleased when she saw who her
visitor was.
</p>

<p>
"I don't remember inviting you," she said.  "I happen to
be alone, so you'd better go."
</p>

<p>
He pushed her aside without offence, and led the way into
the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
"This isn't much of a place," he remarked, glancing
around him disparagingly.  "Couldn't you and Jimmy have
done better than this on six thousand?"
</p>

<p>
"You might leave Jimmy out of it, if you don't mind,"
she told him briefly.  "Also, as I've already said, you weren't
asked to come, so if you don't like it you know what to do."
</p>

<p>
"What's Jimmy doing now?" he pursued.
</p>

<p>
"Working."
</p>

<p>
"And what are you doing?"
</p>

<p>
She frowned at him contemptuously, and he laughed.
</p>

<p>
"No need to get annoyed, Joan.  I've got some good news
for you.  There's a nice flat in Cornwall House waiting for
someone to live in.  It's big—there's a huge panelled
dining-room, a sitting-room you could lose yourself in that cost
six hundred pounds to furnish, and two bedrooms that'd
make a queen happy.  And the Apex is paying for it and
offering you an allowance of two thousand a year for
overhead expenses.  How does that appeal to you, Joan?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I know.  And he has a key and drops in any night he
feels like it.  No, thank you, Snooper!"
</p>

<p>
He was almost pathetically shocked at her frankness.
</p>

<p>
"No, no—not that—Good Lord, Joan!  Wouldn't have
dreamed of suggesting it—don't know what made you
imagine such a thing."
</p>

<p>
"Brought up the way I was, you get that sort of imagination,"
she informed him coolly.  "If it isn't that, what's
the game?  Don't tell me there's a philanthropist behind it,
because I shall shriek with laughter."
</p>

<p>
He fidgeted while she sat down and lighted a cigarette.
It was a side of him she had never seen before, and she
would have mocked at the idea of a fence being so sensitive
if his distress had not been so palpably sincere.
</p>

<p>
"It's the Triangle," he said presently.  "We've got to have
several places in different parts of London, and that flat'll
be one of them.  All you have to do is to live there and spend
your allowance any way you like.  In return, any member
must be able to come and go as he pleases.  The place is really
two small flats knocked into one, so there are two entrances.
If you like, you can lock yourself in half of it at night, and
you can have both the keys of one entrance.  I'll have a
special lock put on the communicating doors, too, if that'll
make you feel more comfortable.  The only thing is to have
some solid tenant—when big expensive flats aren't occupied
the splits are liable to be a little curious, and we can't
afford to take risks.  Won't you think it over again, Joan?"
</p>

<p>
She looked at him through a wreath of smoke.
</p>

<p>
"Who is the Apex—who are the Triangle, for that matter?"
she asked him directly, and his agitation froze into a
menacing stillness.
</p>

<p>
"That doesn't matter to you," he said.  "All you need to
know is that you're part of it, Joan, and you do as you're
told."
</p>

<p>
She stood up and set the long cigarette-holder carefully
between her white teeth.  Hands thrust down into the pockets
of her boyish coat, she stared him straight in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My name happens to be Sands, with a Miss in front
of it," she said steadily.  "All this Joaning is getting on my
nerves.  And as for the Triangle—I don't suppose I shall
ever go to heaven, but I certainly don't intend to go to
Aylesbury!  I'll do my gold-digging where I don't have to
trust a lot of other crooks with my safety.  I'll take on your
job, Snooper, but listen to this: I came into this Triangle
of yours on the understanding that the crooked side of it
didn't touch me, and I meant it.  If you'll have those locks
fixed, you can billet your crooks on me, because I want big
money, and I want it bad.  I'll take a chance of the busies
getting on to me, but they'll never get me inside even as an
accessory.  When do I move?"
</p>

<p>
"This afternoon," said Snooper shortly.  "And you can
drop the high-and-mighty tone, Miss Sands.  It cuts no ice.
You're a crook, even if they don't know you on the
Embankment—your brother's hardly ever out of stir, and the
pair of you come straight from a family of crooks."
</p>

<p>
She opened the door and waved her hand towards the
tiny hall.
</p>

<p>
"I don't intend to breed a family of Triangles, anyway,"
she remarked, and closed the door in his face.
</p>

<p>
James Mattock, returning that evening, was informed
that "Mrs. Mattock" had left, and read the note that was
waiting for him uneasily.  He found her already installed
in the flat in Cornwall House, and looked around at the
palatial furnishing perplexedly.
</p>

<p>
"What's this, Joan?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a matchbox on stilts," she said sarcastically.  "What
did you think it was—a tram?"
</p>

<p>
She was stretched out in a deep-cushioned chair, her
kimono lightly sashed about her, her little bare feet pillowed
in the deep pile of the carpet.  Her fluffy golden hair was
elaborately untidy.  She was arrestingly pretty and attractive.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you waiting for?" Mattock demanded roughly,
but she shook her head and held out a silk-sheathed arm.
</p>

<p>
"Only you, Jimmy.  I'm sorry I was snappy just now.
I've had rather a trying day."
</p>

<p>
"Poor kid!"  He knelt down beside her and laid an arm
about her shoulders.  "But, Joan, who's paying for this?
We can't afford anything like this—it must cost thousands!"
</p>

<p>
"No—it's bringing us thousands," she said.  "Two thousand
a year, and we need it.  And all it means is letting a
few men come in and out.  I'll tell you——"
</p>

<p>
He stood up suddenly and clutched her wrists fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Joan!  <i>Joan!</i>"  His voice was tense with agony.  "Oh, my
darling, what have you done this for?  I've got a job.
Good—good God, Joan——"
</p>

<p>
"No—no—<i>listen</i>, Jimmy!  You've got it all wrong.  Yes,
it <i>is</i> crooked, in a way," she went on desperately.  "It's some
silly gang.  I don't know what they're after, but I'm not in
it.  Only they want a place to—to come to, sometimes, and
there must be somebody always living there, and as I'm one
of them, they got me."
</p>

<p>
"But——"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I know!  I said I'd given it up, but I couldn't.
They've got a hold on me that I can't break—that you can't
break.  The only way to break it is expensive, and I've got
to have that money.  Look—doesn't that mean anything to
you?"
</p>

<p>
She drew back the sleeve and showed him her forearm,
holding it up close to his eyes.  It showed the faint marks of
several small punctures, but Mattock only shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what it is," he said dully.  "But, of course,
I'm a fool anyway...."
</p>

<p>
He sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.
She went on her knees beside him and pressed herself close
to him.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy——"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes ... Joan ..."
</p>

<p>
He took her hand and fondled it, and then he pressed
it to his lips.
</p>

<p>
It was a very long time before he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry.  I'm making a fool of myself.  But I was
afraid."
</p>

<p>
The words fell from his lips in a painful monotone.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go out for a walk.  I'll feel better then."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Storm, following Susan into the Leroy that night, saw
the hatless figure striding madly down Piccadilly and was
puzzled.
</p>

<p>
"You <i>are</i> doing something," Susan accused him.  "I saw
you this morning with a detective—Mr. Teal."
</p>

<p>
"I was being arrested," he said solemnly.  "The charge
was barratry, champerty, and attempted gum-boils, with
complications.  I explained that I was a Quaker and had
never eaten tripe, so after ringing up Carter Paterson's to
verify my alibi they let me go."
</p>

<p>
"I know he was a detective, because he's been in to see
Lord Hannassay.  Have you become a detective?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," he assured her, "though I hope to rise to that
later.  At present I'm looking for a job.  I suppose you
couldn't get me a master carpenter's ticket or a
wood-repairer's diploma, could you?"
</p>

<p>
"What on earth do you want that for?" she asked, and
Storm laughed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm interested in a saw-mill," he said gravely, "and I
want to get inside it.  Unfortunately the owner discourages
visitors—and I'm curious!  I want to rubber round that
saw-mill!  Why have a saw-mill in Billingsgate?  Why not in
Tottenham Court Road or Bloomsbury?  They're just as
aristocratic."
</p>

<p>
That faint smile of his flickered on his lips provocatively,
and she knew him too well to question him further.
</p>

<p>
"A man's been following me about all day," she told
him later.  "I don't know what he wants, but he worries
me.  He hasn't tried to speak to me or anything like
that—just trails round behind me wherever I go."
</p>

<p>
"I'm being followed too," he said with a lightness he
didn't feel.  "And my man isn't a detective, either!  I'll tell
you—we're beautiful, and he's an artist.  We shall be on
the walls of Burlington House next year.  Or have you been
married secretly and are we going to be compromised?"
</p>

<p>
"Stop fooling, Storm," she commanded.
</p>

<p>
He grinned.
</p>

<p>
"My dear soul, what else can one do?  I'll push your little
playmate's face in if you like, but you'll only have
another man in his place to-morrow.  Everybody's being
followed—it must be a new game!  Raegenssen's being
followed, and Sir John Marker's being followed, and Joe
Blaythwayt's being followed, and John Cardan's being
followed, and Sir John Marker's private secretary's being
followed, and I'm being followed, and Inspector Teal's being
followed, and——"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you know what's at the back of it?"
</p>

<p>
"I know what, but I'd perjure my soul to know who!"
said Storm.  "And I take back what I said the other day.
Respectability's exciting!  It's the fiercest sport in the whole
wide world bar haggis-shooting!  Everyone's turning
respectable now, even the crooks, just for the fun of the thing.
Just look over to your right—that little cherub at the next
table but one.  See him?  He's my little pet!  My name's
Mary, and he's a scorching lamb.  We're inseparable, like
Castor and Pollux or Swan and Edgar."
</p>

<p>
He waved a friendly hand to the small neatly dressed
man at the adjoining table, and grinned when his salutation
was coldly ignored.  The girl was mystified.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that?" she asked.  "He looks the most respectable
man in the place."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, he's respectable!" said Storm caustically.  "He's
only killed eleven men!  That, old thing, is Comrade 'Gat'
Morini, and for exactly four years all the policemen in New
York and Chicago have been aching to put him in a hard
chair and run two thousand volts through his spine.  He's
a professional gun artist, and I'll say he guns well!  I ran
into him in Chicago about two years back, and we
exchanged compliments.  His compliment missed my heart
by just over two inches, and mine missed his by exactly one
inch, so I always tell people I won on points.  He loves me
all right—you can stake your socks on uncle!"
</p>

<p>
The gaiety of his smile was entirely unforced, and in
spite of herself Susan shivered, although the steel showed
behind his careless self-confidence.  Even so, she was afraid,
for she knew his cheerful recklessness too well.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you do anything about it?" she suggested.
</p>

<p>
"What?" he demanded promptly.  "There isn't a word
against him.  If I printed what I've just told you there'd be
a libel action within the week, and young Storm wouldn't
win it!  He's committed eleven murders, he's been arrested
eleven times, and he's been released just that number.  It
isn't a crime to follow anyone about."
</p>

<p>
Morini rose a moment after they did, and Storm was
amused to see him greet a loiterer outside with every
appearance of astonishment.  As Storm handed Susan into
a taxi the two reunited friends also decided to charter a taxi,
and Storm grinned again.
</p>

<p>
Lord Hannassay's house was in Hamilton Place, and
Storm felt that his luck was in when he caught sight of the
massive figure of Oscar Raegenssen coming down the steps,
for Raegenssen was a man he particularly wanted to see.
</p>

<p>
As they alighted, another taxi crawled past and stopped
in Park Lane.
</p>

<p>
He watched Susan let herself in, and then hurried after
the Swede.
</p>

<p>
"Excuse me," he said.  "I'm Captain Arden, attached to
the Special Branch at Scotland Yard."
</p>

<p>
"Well?  Please be prief!  I hof an appointment for supper."
</p>

<p>
He was in evening dress, with a foreign-looking cloak
over his shoulders, and his Viking beard overflowed the
white expanse of his shirt-front.
</p>

<p>
"That card you received—does the date mean anything
to you?  Did anything important happen to you on April the
first, or did you do anything important?"
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing!" said Raegenssen curtly.  "It is my
pusiness.  I hof entrosted t'bolicemans wit rezearch.  April
first is day of all the fools.  Thot is all I know."
</p>

<p>
There was nothing to be done.  Storm shrugged, raised
his hat, said good-night, and strolled on.
</p>

<p>
In his flat he found the patient Mr. Teal consoling
himself for a long wait with one of his host's best cigars.
</p>

<p>
"Mecklen is my shadow," said Teal, yawning.  "He's
outside now."
</p>

<p>
"I saw him," said Storm.  "He's got company—Morini
trailed me home.  For sheer plodding industry, give me the
Yankee gunman!"
</p>

<p>
He threw his hat and gloves into a chair and walked
over to the side table on which a decanter and syphon stood.
</p>

<p>
"Been helping yourself to a drink, Teal?" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"I don't drink," said Mr. Teal piously.  "It's bad for my
heart.  Fat men didn't ought to touch alcohol."
</p>

<p>
Storm carried the decanter to the light, held it up, and
inspected the level of the liquid carefully.  Then he called to
Teal, and that stout abstainer came lethargically.
</p>

<p>
"See that little scratch in the glass?" said Storm.  "That's
the level I always keep the whisky up to.  And now there's
about a quarter of an inch more than there was when I went
out.  Some little pal of mine's been kind by stealth.  I love
these subterranean chariteers!"
</p>

<p>
He moistened the tip of one finger with the spirit and
dabbed it on his tongue.  Then he went hastily to the
bathroom and rinsed his mouth out thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
"Aconite, I think," he remarked pleasantly when he
returned.  "Still, we'll send a peg round to the Home Office
Analyst in the morning to make sure."
</p>

<p>
He sat down on the table, forearms resting on his knees,
the cigarette that he was never without pointed optimistically
skywards between his compressed lips.  He grinned at
Mr. Teal, and Mr. Teal's mouth widened half an inch
momentarily, which was about the nearest Mr. Teal ever came
to smiling.
</p>

<p>
"They seem to think you're important," drawled the
detective callously, and Storm nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I was about due for it.  I saw Raegenssen to-night
coming out of Hannassay's—didn't know they were friends!
Dear old Olaf the Seabird was quite rude.  All these people
seem to hate having to try and remember their pasts.  What
can you remember about yourself thirty years ago, Teal?"
</p>

<p>
"I daren't tell you, Captain Arden," said Inspector Teal.
</p>

<p>
They were talking seriously about fifteen minutes later
when the telephone buzzed a warning, and Storm picked up
the instrument.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo... yes...  Susan!...  Yes?"
</p>

<p>
He listened impatiently for a few moments, and then
hung up the receiver violently.
</p>

<p>
"Let's go to a moonlight picnic, Teal!" he crisped, and
picked up his hat as he sprang past the languid detective.
</p>

<p>
He led the way at a breakneck speed down the covered
alley towards the courtyard which opens on to Piccadilly,
but Inspector Teal, showing an agility which one would not
have suspected, kept pace with him fairly comfortably.  Just
level with the porter's lodge, Storm stopped for a moment
and thumbed down the safety catch of his automatic.
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet it's Lew," he said, and stepped calmly out of
cover.
</p>

<p>
They had just reached the foot of the steps when a spurt
of flame leapt out of the darkness of Albany Court Yard,
and something sang viciously past his head.
</p>

<p>
"Rotten bad shooting, comrade," he remarked mildly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal, however, missed the last part of that observation,
for as he spoke Storm fired.  There was a scream of
pain, and a police whistle sounded shrilly.  The next instant
Inspector Teal was deafened by the roar of an open
exhaust.  Storm was already at the wheel of his long silver
Hirondel, and Mr. Teal climbed in beside him briskly, A
crowd had already gathered in the yard, and Storm made
his Klaxon howl urgently.
</p>

<p>
A uniformed man signalled them to stop, but stepped
aside when he recognized the detective.
</p>

<p>
"Arrest that man!" shouted Teal, as they went past.
</p>

<p>
The Hirondel skidded hectically into Piccadilly, swinging
straight across the nose of an omnibus.  There was a
screech of grinding brakes, a chorus of angry yells, and
the silver car lurched across the road and headed west,
gathering speed with powerful ease.
</p>

<p>
They sailed down the slight gradient towards Hyde
Park Corner, cutting in and owl of the stream of traffic with
a daring that made Inspector Teal grip the side of the car
hard and temporarily suspend mastication of his chewing
gum.
</p>

<p>
"Something funny happening at Hannassay's," Storm
explained, raising his voice to make himself heard.
"Secretary rang me up—two men trying to get in the back door,
and Hannassay in his bedroom, locked in, and can't be
woken.  I heard a shot, and then the line went dead.
Respectability—huh!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br><br>
TALKING OF TRIANGLES
</h3>

<p>
Susan Hawthorne saw the door of the library opening
slowly, and her heart stood still.
</p>

<p>
The man outside was Morini—she saw his baby blue
eyes above the white silk muffler that was bound about the
lower part of his face.  She saw something else that was
blue, also, but by no means baby like, something that came
up like the head of a striking snake....
</p>

<p>
The electric light switch was close to her hand, and she
clicked it down and ducked swiftly.  Even as she did so
the sudden darkness was split by a streak of orange fire, and
a deafening explosion battered on her ear-drums and left
them buzzing painfully.  The next instant she had smashed
the heavy telephone twice against the delicate lever of the
switch and efficiently mangled the mechanism.
</p>

<p>
She moved silently away along the wall, and the terrible
hunt began.  The girl was helped by her knowledge of the
room, but Morini crept after her with an uncanny accuracy
in spite of the impenetrable blackness.  Her chest was heaving
so that it seemed as if every breath she took must betray
her whereabouts as surely as a siren.  The door was a little
ajar, and the lights in the hall were on.  There was no escape
that way, for he would see her as she was silhouetted
against the glare, and she had already had enough evidence
of the grimness of his purpose.  Once she saw him step cat-wise
across the pencil of light that the hall bulbs smudged
across the room, and with difficulty choked back the cry
that would have been fatal.  Once he fired again, at random,
and she only just had time to drop behind a couch out of the
way of the more accurate shot that followed instantly on
the echo of the first when the brief flash had given him his
bearings.
</p>

<p>
From outside came a swelling drone that grew in volume
with startling speed and then died into a breathless purr
coincident with the muffled squeal of rubber tearing on
asphalt.  Hardly two seconds later the bell at the back of the
house rang stridently, and someone pounded on the front
door.
</p>

<p>
Through the half-open window came Storm's voice:
</p>

<p>
"Stand clear of the lift gates, please!  This is where I
damage architecture!"
</p>

<p>
She saw Morini slip through the door and out into the
corridor, and then with a dreadful premonition she rushed
to the window and flung up the lower sash.  Storm and
Inspector Teal were on the step, and Storm already had his
automatic crammed against the Yale lock and his finger was
on the trigger.
</p>

<p>
"Storm!  Stop!" she cried, and he looked round.  "Morini's
in the hall and the back door's broken in—he'll get you as
you come in and escape easily!"
</p>

<p>
He only hesitated for a second.  Then—
</p>

<p>
"That be bullraced for a yarn!" he sang out recklessly.
"All aboard for hell!"
</p>

<p>
She heard the explosion as she dashed across the room
and opened the door wide.  The two men crashed into the
hall, but she did not look at them.  She was straining her
eyes into the shadows at the end of the passage which led to
the servants' quarters, and, used as she was to the darkness,
she saw Morini a space of time before they did ... saw his
gun leap up ... and hurled the priceless vase she carried....
</p>

<p>
Three automatics detonated almost as one.
</p>

<p>
Morini was hit by the vase as he pressed the trigger, and
his shot went high, splintering the transom above the front
door.  As Storm fired back he raced towards the servants'
entrance.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal laid an unexpectedly gentle arm about the girl's
shoulders and led her into the library.
</p>

<p>
"There's another light," she said, trying to keep her voice
level.  "I smashed the big switch.  A reading lamp, on the
table—it's lucky Morini didn't find it."
</p>

<p>
Teal, groping round, located the lamp and turned it on.
A moment later Storm returned.  He had rolled back his
sleeve and was endeavouring to tie his handkerchief round
his wrist, and to her surprise and disgust she said the
conventional thing.
</p>

<p>
"You're hurt."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," he assured her.  "Only a graze—dear
old Gat's going off, and I think I must be, too.  It's time
some of us old soldiers retired—Gat and I wouldn't have
missed each other in Chicago!"
</p>

<p>
"He got away?" said Teal.
</p>

<p>
Storm nodded.
</p>

<p>
"That's the day's safety bet—clean!  He got through into
Park Lane, and there was a fast car waiting for him.  All
lights out, so I missed the number.  It was Morini, of course,
but we couldn't get a conviction—the defence'd produce
half a dozen small men with washed-out blue eyes that you
couldn't distinguish from Morini if they were all dressed
alike and had scarves spliced on their dials."  He looked at
Teal, and his gunmetal grey eyes were alight with challenge.
"And this is only the opening chorus.  You wait till
the balloon goes up!"
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal stroked his bowler.
</p>

<p>
"Where's Hannassay?" he asked prosaically.
</p>

<p>
"Je-rusalem!  I'd forgotten him.  The fireworks ought to
have woken him if nothing else will."
</p>

<p>
Upstairs, after an unavailing assault on the door of
Hannassay's bedroom, Storm went around to the adjoining
bathroom, climbed out of the window, and edged his way
perilously along a two-inch ledge with the assistance of a
rickety drainpipe.  He came back to report that the room was
empty.
</p>

<p>
"He must be out," Susan said.  "It never occurred to me,
though—he generally tells me where and when he's going
so that any important messages can be sent on."
</p>

<p>
"Did he always lock his bedroom?" asked Storm, and
she nodded.
</p>

<p>
"He had a safe there with all his private papers.  The
room's always locked as soon as his valet has swept it out to
make the bed."
</p>

<p>
"Let's hope it wasn't burgled," said Teal.  "Didn't you
say there were two men at the back door?"
</p>

<p>
They went round to the back, and the detective made an
inspection with the aid of his pocket torch.  The door had
been burst open with a jemmy of a peculiar pattern, and
Inspector Teal examined the marks with a professional eye.
</p>

<p>
"That's Prester John's work," he declared.  "I know that
jemmy of his—he invented it himself, and it's guaranteed
to make a safe look like a sardine tin."
</p>

<p>
"Get back to the Yard and send an all-station call for
Morini and John," instructed Storm.  "Send Henderson up
here for the rest of the night, and tell Rankin to be ready to
relieve him at eight to-morrow.  Find out where they took
Mecklen, and ring me here.  I'll wait till Henderson
arrives....  There mayn't be another attempt to-night, but
if there are any strategists on the staff of the Triangle there
may be.  Oh, and tell Henderson to bring some burglarious
gadgets along with him—I want to see if that safe's all
right.  I can't get in through the window—there's a patent
fastening inside, and not enough handhold outside for an
athletic fly."
</p>

<p>
When the detective had gone, he made a careful round
of the room, but found nothing.  Then he turned to the
girl.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what it is you're supposed to have discovered,"
he said, "but there's a bad hombre in the background
who seems to think you spoil the view!  Can you remember
anything unusual you've come across in Hannassay's papers?"
</p>

<p>
She thought for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"No....  Well, yes, a few days ago he made me search
his files for something about a man named Mattock.
Somebody who forged a cheque with Lord Hannassay's
signature and was caught and sent to prison."
</p>

<p>
"Did you mention that to anyone?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, as a matter of fact, though I suppose I shouldn't
have.  It was an uncle of mine on my mother's side—I didn't
know where he was, but in the City the other day I ran into
Uncle Joe and he made me have lunch with him.  He always
was interested in crime, and of course he started talking
about it almost immediately.  Then I happened to mention
Mattock's dossier, and he seemed awfully interested—but
Uncle Joe's interested in the weirdest things."
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Joe who?" Storm asked.
</p>

<p>
"Blaythwayt.  He's got a job as manager——"
</p>

<p>
"Of the City and Continental Bank, Lombard Street,
which same firm is honoured with the account of Olaf the
Seabird.  Je-rusalem!  Things do run in circles!  Why isn't
this Regent's Park?"
</p>

<p>
Just before Henderson arrived a call came through on
the upstairs telephone, and Storm learned that Lew Mecklen
had been taken to St. George's Hospital suffering from
nothing more serious than a flesh wound in the thigh, and
that a detective was already guarding him.  So far he had
refused to make any statement.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see him first thing to-morrow," said Storm.  "Get
hold of the Assistant Commissioner.  Lew must be charged
to-morrow morning."
</p>

<p>
He shook hands with Henderson and led the way upstairs.
From the detective he received a small leather wallet
of fine steel tools and reviewed them critically.
</p>

<p>
"Anyone might think I was going to smash a strongroom,"
he murmured.  "Gather round for a demonstration
of expert yeggship!"
</p>

<p>
It took him only a couple of minutes to manipulate the
lock, and then he straightened himself and pushed open the
door.
</p>

<p>
The safe was untouched, and nothing appeared to have
been disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"This is not exciting," he remarked, and re-locked the
door on the outside with his instruments.
</p>

<p>
They returned to the library, and he gave Henderson his
instructions.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it's all wrong," he concluded.  "The Triangle
are so keen on broadcasting their visiting cards—why
haven't we got a memento of their call?"
</p>

<p>
While Henderson talked to the girl, Storm embarked on
a fresh search of the house.  He combed every inch of every
room and corridor, and was raking the study upstairs when
Lord Hannassay himself arrived.  Storm heard the voices
downstairs, and came down with the irritating belief that
he had overlooked something.  As a matter of fact, he had,
for as he descended the stairs he saw something gleaming
at the edge of the rug in the hall.
</p>

<p>
It was a silver triangle similar to the one Inspector Teal
had showed him, and had obviously been kicked out of sight
when they charged in—it was barely visible except when it
caught the light in a certain way.
</p>

<p>
Susan was just telling Lord Hannassay her story when
Storm stroked in.
</p>

<p>
"Look for the trade mark on every genuine article," he
said.  "I hate these anonymous presents!"
</p>

<p>
He held out the token in one triumphant palm as he spokes
and the peer turned to greet him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Captain Arden——"
</p>

<p>
His voice trailed away, and they saw him suddenly go
white.  Henderson was just in time to catch him as he
fell.
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal stood on the threshold, a burly figure, hat
in hand.
</p>

<p>
"I just dropped in——" he was starting to explain, and
then he caught sight of the limp form in Henderson's arms
and his jaw dropped.
</p>

<p>
Storm put an arm around Hannassay and brushed Henderson
aside.  Then he jerked the unconscious man from the
floor and, heavy as he was, carried him without any
apparent effort to the chesterfield.
</p>

<p>
He left the two detectives to apply restoratives, and led
the girl over to the window.
</p>

<p>
Storm was the last man on earth she would ever have
associated with nerves.  He was too essentially
virile—dynamic—and there was too much grim strength in every line
of his lean, tanned face.  His eyes were as cold and steady
as chilled granite, and his every least movement showed
the supple grace of the born fighting man.  And yet the
hand he laid on her arm trembled, and when he spoke she
was amazed to detect the faintest unevenness in his voice.
</p>

<p>
"Hannassay fainted as though he'd seen a ghost, didn't
he?" he said.  "And I know the ghost.  My God!——  Life's
queer!"
</p>

<p>
"Was it the Triangle you showed him?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
He shook his head, and his white teeth gleamed in a
mirthless smile.
</p>

<p>
"The Triangle brought it, but the ghost's name was
Mattock!" said Storm.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
<br><br>
BLAYTHWAYT ON CLUES
</h3>

<p>
In spite of the hour, the nucleus of a crowd had already
gathered outside, with that peculiar instinct for the morbid
which is the gift of crowds; and Storm had to fight his
way to a taxi through the first batch of eager reporters.
</p>

<p>
He found the vanguard of another contingent sitting
patiently on his doorstep when he got back to the Albany, and
was instantly deluged with questions.
</p>

<p>
"I can give you no information at present," he repeated
for the umteenth time.  "Also, I want to get a couple of
hours' rest before breakfast.  Try your luck later."
</p>

<p>
Fifteen minutes afterwards he rolled into bed and fell at
once into a calm, untroubled sleep.
</p>

<p>
He breakfasted at seven-thirty in his dressing-gown,
already bathed and shaved, and he was looking as cool and
fresh as if he had had nine hours' healthy slumber instead
of two.  The table was littered with newspapers, and folded
sheets were propped up against every available support in
front of him.  He read while he ate.  In spite of his own
reticence, someone at the Yard had evidently talked
unguardedly, for the stop-press columns were full of sensational
hints in small closely set type.
</p>

<p>
"This will be all over the world in three hours," he said
resignedly, and Inspector Teal, who had dropped in for a
cup of coffee, nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that it matters much.  The real point of
advertising a crime is to call up the noses, and I doubt if
there'll be much nosing the Triangle.  Do you know, when
they searched Lew he had five hundred pounds on him?
You can't nose a gang who can pay that well."
</p>

<p>
Storm drove down to the hospital after breakfast to see
the injured gunman, and found him confidently defiant.
</p>

<p>
"Ef yew think yew're gonna git a squeak outer me, yew
sure gotten another guess comin', Cap."
</p>

<p>
Storm sat down by the side of the bed and lighted a
cigarette.  He had already surmised that it would be difficult
to make Lew Mecklen talk, and he had the disadvantage
of being on the right side of the law, which put the more
obvious methods of securing information out of the question.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know what the law is in the States," he said,
"and I don't know if you know what it is over here.
Anyway, in England we have a thing called King's Evidence,
and it's saved one or two people's necks before now."
</p>

<p>
Lew shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Quit kiddin', son," he advised.  "Yew cain't hang me
fer doin' a bit of fancy shootin' around yore haid.  Yew
weren't injured any.  All yew bulls c'n do is ter lock me up
fer a time—an' then I've gotten yew all skinned a mile!"
</p>

<p>
The thought seemed to amuse him, for his big chest
heaved with silent guffaws.
</p>

<p>
"You can get your sentence reduced by helping us to
round up the rest of the gang," Storm pointed out.  "And
I can get you a longer stretch if you're obstinate."
</p>

<p>
"Yew c'n go ter hell any time," said Mecklen, and chuckled
again.  "Aw—mother!  Take 'im outside an' tie a halo
round 'is baby braow.  Tell me good-bye, buddy, an' go
home, or yew'll make me die laughin'!  Put ole Lew in jail?"
he scoffed.  "I'm an Amurrican cidizen, bo, an' don't yew
fergit it."
</p>

<p>
"Since when has America been using the slums of
Leipzig as a breeding-ground?" inquired Storm mildly.  "Mecklen,
you synthetic Americans make me tired!  In case you're
interested, I'll say you're nothing more than a fourth-rate
Hun thug, and your pal Morini's about as American as you
are—which means he's a plain ornery Dago!"
</p>

<p>
He held a consultation with the house-surgeon, and was
unaccountably annoyed at the report he received.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, if you insist, Captain Arden, I can do nothing;
but I strongly advise against moving him."
</p>

<p>
"How long is it likely to be before we can take him
away?" Storm asked, and the doctor spread out his hands.
</p>

<p>
"It may be any time," was his unsatisfactory answer.
"I'll do my best to get him patched up as soon as possible—you
can be sure of that.  But if you move him now, you may
be sued for damages later, and that wouldn't do you any
good."
</p>

<p>
As Storm drove back along Piccadilly he saw that nearly
every poster advertising the early editions of the evening
papers bore an enlarged reproduction of the Alpha Triangle.
He bought a copy of the <i>Evening Record</i> and found
the latest Fleet Street conjectures stunted across four
columns and crowned with bloodcurdling headlines.
</p>

<p>
He rang up Susan from Scotland Yard, and had the
disappointment of hearing that she was already engaged for
lunch.
</p>

<p>
"Lord Hannassay leaves for a holiday the day after
to-morrow," she added.  "He's going down through Spain,
then to Teneriffe, and finishing up with a tour down the
West African coast."
</p>

<p>
This was news to Storm, and, incidentally, an unexpected
blessing for with Lord Hannassay out of the way a
responsibility would be off his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you lunching with?" he demanded jealously.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle Joe."
</p>

<p>
"Damn Uncle Joe!" snarled Storm, and her soft, amused
laughter reached his ears before he hung up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
Joe Blaythwayt had come into his own.  Few of the
callers he interviewed that morning failed to make some
remarks about the Triangle, and Joe made the best of the
secondhand scraps of out-of-the-way knowledge he had
acquired from Inspector Teal.
</p>

<p>
"I know criminals," he would say to the scoffers, with
morbid satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the Joe Blaythwayt who discussed evil-doers
and evil deeds with a Central Detective-Inspector in
his leisure moments was a very different man from the Joe
Blaythwayt who conducted the business of the Lombard
Street branch of the City and Continental Bank.  Still alert,
eyes still ready to twinkle, frequent of laughter—yes.  But
eminently practical and business-like.
</p>

<p>
He was business-like when he held his usual weekly interview
with Raegenssen in the snug little office to which the
roar of traffic came but faintly.
</p>

<p>
It was a highly business-like occasion—one of those
colossal moments during which the most unassuming man
is justified in donning horn-rimmed spectacles and a cigar,
sticking his thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, and
generally adopting the accent and demeanour of the Man
of Big Business.  For Raegenssen was augmenting his
account by a sum which exceeded even his ordinary weekly
contributions—and they would have represented
Blaythwayt's income for a year.
</p>

<p>
He dropped a wad of hundred-pound notes on the table
as carelessly as a merely rich man might have paid in a
handful of fivers.  The manager counted them with a
similar dispassionate air, and passed them over to the
cashier as if they were so much waste paper; for Joe Blaythwayt
was a stickler for the etiquette of his profession.
</p>

<p>
But, business over, he degenerated into a human being.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, you've seen the papers," he remarked.
</p>

<p>
The Swede nodded.
</p>

<p>
"It is ter pig bluff," he said.
</p>

<p>
He glared at the inoffensive Joe as though he suspected
him of being in league with the gang.
</p>

<p>
"Plackmail!" he declared violently.  "Ant I shall nod
bay!"
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt watched the departure of the huge Viking
figure in its ill-fitting clothes thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
Oscar Raegenssen drove back to Cockspur Street, where
he occupied a palatial suite of offices in Scandinavia House.
He sat over his desk for a long time, his big, capable hands
toying with a ridiculously small pencil.  Crag-like jaw
outthrust, he stared truculently into space.  His leonine head
was set at an arrogant angle—he looked by no means an
easy man to intimidate.
</p>

<p>
Presently he pressed the bell at his side, and there was a
knock on the door.
</p>

<p>
"Gom!" he commanded curtly, and Mattock entered.
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen took the little bundle of pink slips from his
clerk's hand and spread them out on the blotting-paper in
front of him.  With ponderous deliberation he scrawled his
thick untidy signature in the bottom right-hand corner of
each; and when he had finished he gathered them up, counted
them, and studied every one minutely.
</p>

<p>
"Two are missing!"
</p>

<p>
"I have them here," Mattock said.  "I've written nothing
on them—they're for large sums."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
Mattock showed his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"You forget my reputation, sir," he said gently.
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen regarded his clerk inscrutably.  Mattock met
the stare boldly—almost insolently.  Then, without a word,
Raegenssen wrote out the cheques, blotted them, and handed
them back.
</p>

<p>
Although Raegenssen's were vaguely described in the
directory as "Agents," the City knew them very little.  It
was rumoured that the Swede was a gigantic speculator in
foreign exchanges, and certainly large sums of exotic
currencies passed through the Scandinavia House offices and
between London and the firm's correspondents in
Marseilles, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Genoa.
</p>

<p>
"Next week ter will pe ingoming monies.  You will nodify
Amstertam as usual.  That iss all.  Go!"
</p>

<p>
"There was something I wanted to mention, sir, if you'll
excuse me," Mattock said.
</p>

<p>
"Gondinue—yess?"
</p>

<p>
"The safe you have in the office is of an old pattern.  It
would be child's play to an expert safe-breaker."
</p>

<p>
"Gondinue—yess?"
</p>

<p>
"Mightn't it be wiser, sir, to get a new safe—or, better
still, keep the papers at the bank?  If anything should
happen, the police would be after me at once.  Once a man's
made a break, they never let him go."
</p>

<p>
"Gondinue—yess?"
</p>

<p>
"They are rather private papers, sir?"
</p>

<p>
Cold blue eyes bored mercilessly into insolent brown
ones.
</p>

<p>
"Hof you seen ter babers?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, but—"
</p>

<p>
"What mages you tink we hof anydings to gonceal?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, sir, but the private correspondence of any
business—"
</p>

<p>
"Gondinue—yess?"
</p>

<p>
"That's all, sir," Mattock concluded lamely.
</p>

<p>
"Thang you.  Go!"
</p>

<p>
Towards three o'clock Raegenssen rose, tidied his desk,
picked up his battered felt hat.
</p>

<p>
The safe to which Mattock had taken exception stood in
one corner of the room—a great massive affair that seemed
to occupy half the office.  It was eight feet high by three feet
wide by three feet deep, and it was Oscar Raegenssen's especial
joy.  There was a glitter of amusement in his eyes as he
comprehended its imposing bulk.
</p>

<p>
He locked the door of his sanctum and passed through
the outer office where his two clerks and Mattock worked.
Only Mattock was left, and he was at that moment drawing
on his waterproof preparatory to departure, for
Raegenssen's closed early.
</p>

<p>
"It's come on to rain, sir," he remarked.  "Have you your
car outside, or shall I fetch a taxi?"
</p>

<p>
"Ter gar is in St. James's Square.  You will blease
summon it."
</p>

<p>
Storm, endeavouring to appear interested in Inspector
Teal's lengthy monologue on the psychology of the criminal,
had been suddenly seized with what struck him as
being an exceptionally brilliant idea.  He took up the
telephone and gave a number in the City.
</p>

<p>
"I want to speak to Mr. Blaythwayt, please....
Captain Arden of the Criminal Investigation Department."
</p>

<p>
He was unpleasantly conscious of Mr. Teal's curious
gaze, and fervently wished that he had delayed putting his
idea into practice until that portly sleuth had taken his
leave.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo ... yes....  Can you see me almost immediately,
Mr. Blaythwayt?  This Triangle affair—it's an awful
nuisance, I know; but it can't be helped....  You're
just going out to lunch? ... No, I'm afraid I can't—I've
got a lot of other things to attend to this afternoon.  Look
here, if I shan't intrude, will you lunch with me? ... Susan
Hawthorne?  Je-ru-salem, that's funny! ... Yes—known
her for years!  I remember now; you're her uncle,
aren't you? ... No, I'm sure she won't mind.  I'd tell you
over the 'phone, but I hate invisible backchatters! ... I'll
pick you up at the <i>Record</i> office in under ten minutes.  So
long!"
</p>

<p>
"She's a nice kid, that Miss Hawthorne," observed the
somniloquent Mr. Teal, as Storm put down the instrument.
</p>

<p>
Storm was not inclined to be conversational on the subject.
</p>

<p>
"M'm.  You know, sir, I always say a young man ought
to get married.  It kind of puts a kick into his work.  And if
there's kids, it gives him something to work for.  Now, I
was married when I was a youngster of twenty-two, walking
my beat like any cub copper.  Well, believe me, sir, it
made a new man of me, and when we had our First—that
was four months after——"
</p>

<p>
"Teal," said Storm awfully, "you're shocking me.  Go
away and blow froth."
</p>

<p>
He collected Blaythwayt at the bank, and they parked
the car in Salisbury Square and proceeded on foot to the
Fleet Street restaurant where Joe had arranged to meet his
niece.  She was surprised to see Storm, and, in his state of
exaggerated self-consciousness, he thought she was a trifle
displeased.  Thinking things over, he realised the painful
transparency of his ruse.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to butt in on you like this," he said.  "Fact is,
it's important for me to see your uncle, and I shan't have ten
consecutive free seconds this afternoon."
</p>

<p>
Joe Blaythwayt tucked his napkin into his waistcoat and
beamed at them both impartially.
</p>

<p>
"Anything I can do for you, Captain Arden——"
</p>

<p>
This placed Storm in a quandary, for he hadn't the
foggiest notion of an excuse for his presence.  The timely
arrival of an overworked waiter gave him a few minutes'
respite, during which time his brain seethed frantically, and
at the end of it he was prepared to be fluently plausible.
</p>

<p>
"Teal is always talking about you, Mr. Blaythwayt.  He
says you're a great criminologist."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I've read a bit about it," admitted Joe modestly.
"It's difficult, of course, to do much as an amateur.  Now,
this Triangle, Captain Arden, is the very first time I've ever
been mixed up in anything of the sort personally.  I shall put
it in my book—I'm writing a book, you know.  Did Teal
tell you that?"
</p>

<p>
Storm nodded.  He glanced at Susan and then exerted
himself not to meet her eye, for her initial annoyance had
given place to quiet amusement.  He felt her eyes upon him,
and went hot and cold.
</p>

<p>
"And you absolutely can't remember a thing about Harchester
that you could associate with the Triangle?" he
asked.
</p>

<p>
"Not a thing," said Blaythwayt with a vigorous shake of
his head.  "Of course, some people must have been jealous—I
was jolly good at Rugger in my time, and Harchester
thinks more of brawn than of brains, so I became captain
of the school rather out of my turn.  But that's all so long
ago I can't remember details.  Certainly nobody disliked me
to my face, whatever they may have thought."
</p>

<p>
"Who was the bird you cut out?"
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt wrinkled his brow.
</p>

<p>
"I can remember him a bit.  A big fellow, no good at
games—he was so gawky everyone used to rag him about
it.  Bull-something ... Bull ... Bulsaid—that's it!
He was brilliantly clever, I remember that.  I often wonder
what happened to him.  He ought to have become a great
scientist.  But, bless you, Bulsaid never kicked.  He was too
quiet.  One of the most easy-going fellows I've ever met."
</p>

<p>
Susan turned to Storm with a smile.
</p>

<p>
"Is Uncle's school life so terrifically important?" she
asked sweetly.
</p>

<p>
"Fearfully," Storm assured her gravely.
</p>

<p>
She shook her head, and all mischief was in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You're forgiven," she said, and the simple Joe blinked
uncomprehendingly at the laughter that followed.
</p>

<p>
The rest of the meal was delightful, and Storm listened
soberly to the account of Blaythwayt's literary aspirations,
interspersing the recital at intervals with the most innocent
expressions of admiration.
</p>

<p>
"About this Triangle, though—seriously!" he said later.
"There's going to be trouble, and it's going to be tough!
You've heard what they've done already—tried to poison
me, shot me up, and sent the gentle Gat gunning for Susan.
And that's before they've committed a single crime against
the men they've threatened.  I say 'threatened,' although no
threats have been put on paper in so many words.  But I
guess if I got one of those little valentines I'd look under
my bed before I got into it, whether they said, 'This is where
you get yours,' or not!  What do you make of it?"
</p>

<p>
"Crime on a big scale," said Blaythwayt impressively.
"It's a solid possibility, as a commercial investment, to a
man with capital and genius."
</p>

<p>
Joe's simplicity was his great charm.
</p>

<p>
"As I see it, Captain Arden, criminals would never be
caught if they didn't leave Clues.  Consequently, in order to
be a successful criminal, all you have to do is to master the
art of not leaving Clues.  And, as a detective, you will only
run the Triangle to earth by looking for and following up
Clues.  The ordinary police methods of searching for Clues
are inadequate.  There are too many hindrances—you
should be able to enter houses without search warrants, take
people into custody and interrogate them on the slightest
provocation, and adopt any means you choose in order to
accumulate evidence.  The Detective should be above the
Law."
</p>

<p>
Storm shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not a pukka detective," he said, "and Teal owes me
ten bob."
</p>

<p>
"Are you being funny," demanded Susan, "or is there
likely to be more trouble?"
</p>

<p>
He looked at her steadily, eyes half closed, his cigarette
between his lips.
</p>

<p>
"You're scared!" he said.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm not absolutely praying to be killed."
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence, for he had no wish to alarm
her unduly.  And yet, to minimise the danger would not be
the thought of anyone but a born fool.  He turned his eyes
on Blaythwayt.
</p>

<p>
"Are <i>you</i> scared?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't say I've thought about it seriously," confessed
Joe.  "I really don't see that I have much to fear—far less,
anyway, than I have to fear from bank robbers and
kiters—that's an American word for bank swindlers," he
explained unnecessarily.  "Inspector Teal, my very good
friend, always says that violent crime is foreign to this
country.  A few attempts by dagoes and suchlike, perhaps,
but they can easily be rounded up.  It's just a coincidence
that a threat should have come to me.  One can understand
them being sent to the others.  Public men are bound to
receive threatening letters, but they very rarely come to
anything."
</p>

<p>
Storm would have liked to point out the minor coincidences
of alcohol diluted with aconite, and firework displays
in Albany Court Yard and Hamilton Place, but
refrained.
</p>

<p>
"What's your honest opinion, Kit?" Susan persisted.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, Mecklen's in hospital, and we've got Morini's
description.  There may be a bit of fun before he's found,"
he conceded easily, "but I don't think you need be afraid.
I'd like you to stay with some friends of mine, though, while
Hannassay's away.  You don't want to be alone in that huge
house—besides, it's so dull.  You'll like 'em—Terry
Mannering's a great lad.  But don't go liking him too much,
because he's already married!"
</p>

<p>
"You needn't be afraid of that," she told him coldly, and
did not realise for five minutes why he smiled.
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt pulled out his watch.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I really must be off, Captain Arden.  It's
nearly a quarter to three—please don't think I'm rude, my
dear fellow, but Business..."
</p>

<p>
When Joe Blaythwayt spoke of weighty matters he always
gave the impression that he talked in capital letters.
</p>

<p>
In Salisbury Square he inspected every inch of the silver
Hirondel with an almost childish awe.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could afford a car like this," he said wistfully.
"Can she Go?"
</p>

<p>
"Go?" scoffed Storm.  "She's the fastest thing on wheels
that you can use on the road!  I've tried her up to a hundred
and fifteen at Brooklands."  He had an inspiration.  "Get in
and let's have a run—I'll be taking Susan home, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"Can we really?" said Joe, and Storm had shepherded
him into the back seat before he had quite decided whether
to accept the invitation.
</p>

<p>
He had, apparently, forgotten the calls of Business.
</p>

<p>
They whirled round Trafalgar Square, and Storm hesitated
momentarily between Cockspur Street and the Mall.
He decided on Cockspur Street, and to this day the thought
of the far-reaching effects of that casual decision makes
him gasp.
</p>

<p>
Oscar Raegenssen, waiting for the arrival of his luxurious
Navarre cabriolet, saw a man whom he particularly
wished to avoid sauntering down from Pall Mall.  He looked
up and down the street, but there was no sign of his car.
With a slight gesture of annoyance he started to cross the
road.
</p>

<p>
He stepped directly in front of the bonnet of Storm's
car.  The fine drizzle that was falling lay on the road like thin
oil, and Storm knew at once that it would be impossible to
pull up in time on the treacherous surface, for he was doing
over thirty miles an hour.  He wrenched the wheel over to
the right as he braked, and one wing just caught Raegenssen
as the Hirondel skidded round.  Luckily the street was
almost deserted, and the silver car turned completely round
in a space of feet and fetched up against the kerb, facing
back towards Trafalgar Square.
</p>

<p>
It was a magnificent piece of driving, but the most
masterly driver in the world could not have saved Raegenssen
from that blow.
</p>

<p>
Storm jumped from his seat and ran towards the stunned
man, an excited Joe hard on his heels.  He picked the Swede
up in his arms and carried him to the pavement.  He was
loosening the clothes about Raegenssen's throat, with Blaythwayt
trying ineffectually to assist, when a tall, oldish man
elbowed his way through the crowd and knelt down beside
him.
</p>

<p>
"Your boss, Mattock," remarked Storm briefly.
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen was not badly hurt.  He was even then recovering
consciousness.  His eyelids flickered dazedly, and his
lips framed an almost inaudible word.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sylvia ... Sylvia...</i>"
</p>

<p>
"He's coming round," said Storm to the constable who
had joined the group.  "He stepped out right in front of me
without looking where he was going, but I only grazed
him."
</p>

<p>
"This gentleman is Captain Arden of the Special
Branch," announced Blaythwayt pompously.
</p>

<p>
Storm was searching in his pockets for a card, and Susan
saw that his jaw was tightened up so that the muscles stood
out in faintly serrated knots, and his eyes were abnormally
level.
</p>

<p>
Wondering, she looked at the others.  Joe Blaythwayt
was standing by importantly with a broad smile on his
face, and yet he was trembling with excitement.  Mattock
had looked up from applying first aid to his employer, and
was staring at one of the other two—she could not be sure
which.  His features were contorted, his mouth working,
and there was a blaze in his eyes that set her heart pounding
against her ribs like a trip-hammer.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
<br><br>
IMMIGRATION OF THE UNGODLY
</h3>

<p>
Storm breakfasted with Hannassay on the morning his
lordship left for his holiday.  It was an unexpected
invitation, but Lord Hannassay came to the reason of it without
delay.
</p>

<p>
"I have made arrangements for you to be given complete
charge of the case," he said.  "You will probably get
the official intimation when you reach the Yard."
</p>

<p>
His usual abruptness of manner was conspicuously absent.
He spoke restrainedly and rather artificially, like a
man who has planned out his speech in advance and
intends to adhere rigidly to a premeditated sequence of
words.
</p>

<p>
"You will have <i>carte blanche</i>, and you may use any means
you think fit within—and, by special arrangement, without—the
law to round up the Alpha Triangle.  I am convinced
that the menace with which we are faced is the greatest in
the history of crime."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad to have your support," said Storm.  "I more
than scent rodents myself!  But I thought I was in for some
job persuading the authorities I wasn't an alarmist."
</p>

<p>
The peer nodded absently and stirred his coffee.  He
seemed hardly to have heard Kit's remark, and when he
spoke again it was in the same mechanical way as before, as
though he neither anticipated nor required interruption.
</p>

<p>
"Strictly between ourselves, Captain Arden, I know the
secret of the Alpha Triangle."  He pushed away his plate
and lighted a cigar.  "That, I think, should surprise you.
You will ask, also, why I do not place my information at
the service of the police.  There is a reason for that—a
reason which I cannot explain to you now, but which will be
clear to you when, and if, you run the gang to earth.  The
Alpha Triangle is an organisation which came into existence
originally for the purposes of revenge—the purpose
for which it was organised by a genius who, I sometimes
think, is mad.  You have, of course, been interested in the
murder—it was murder, by the way—of Joubert, a few
months ago.  That was the first crime of the Triangle, and
yet I offer for your contemplation the paradox that until
five minutes before the murder there was no Alpha Triangle."
</p>

<p>
Storm sat without comment, although he was literally
amazed at the confession he had just heard.  Lord Hannassay,
whose eyes throughout had been fixed vacantly on the
opposite wall, after the fashion of a child repeating a
lesson, looked at him suddenly and surprised that look of
consternation.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly—I am deliberately admitting that I am, in a
sense, an accessory," he said with a smile.  "I must ask you
to accept the extraordinary situation, the cause of which
will be apparent to you at the successful conclusion of your
labours.  The Alpha Triangle, then," he went on, "from
being a purely revengeful society, became an acquisitively
criminal one.  I ask you to take my word on that score, for
although the Triangle has committed no acquisitive crimes
up to date, I have every reason to believe that it will make
up for the deficiency in the future.  This transition, already
an accomplished fact—in the spirit, if not in the deed—must
have already occurred to you as a probability.  What,
indeed, could be more natural than that such an
organisation, having established a powerful and unscrupulous
society for taking its vengeances, should visualise the possibilities
for material gain latent in such a society?  The power is
there—a power, Captain Arden, which, if you knew its
magnitude and the utter, cold, superhuman inflexibility of
the man who controls it, might make even you, in spite of
your reputation for physical prowess and indomitable
courage, turn back from the task you seem so eager to undertake."
</p>

<p>
For all the precise, calculated levelness of Lord Hannassay's
voice, there was an earnestness behind his pedantic
sentences that pricked the small hairs on the nape of Storm's
neck like a chill wind.  And yet this was a purely reflex
sensation, for Storm smiled lightly and flicked the ash from his
cigarette with leisured care.
</p>

<p>
"I'll take the risk," he drawled.
</p>

<p>
Lord Hannassay nodded slowly.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you would," he said.  "You're the sort that
would."
</p>

<p>
"And that's not what they call 'sand,' either," said Storm,
and his mocking smile flitted elusively across his lips.  "I'll
give it you, Lord Hannassay, straight, that I'd rather
tackle anything else under the sun than this Triangle
business.  And I could throw in my hand—I'm not a detective,
and I'm not even in Special Branch regularly.  I stay on simply
because it's a challenge.  I've got some sort of a reputation
among disreputable people—<i>Storm won't be beat till
he's buried, and maybe not then</i>, they'll tell you.  And they've
got it all wrong!  It's pride—arrogance—conceit—anything
you care to call it.  But all it stews down to is just that I'm
too bucked with myself—it'd break my heart to have to
admit I was beaten!  I'd sooner go down fighting, because if
I'm beaten that way I'll never have to admit it."
</p>

<p>
He spoke without a trace of affectation, and yet it was
an analysis he had never made to anyone in his life before.
Later, Lord Hannassay knew the reason for that frankness,
yet even at the time Storm's simple directness appealed to
him.
</p>

<p>
The peer rose and held out his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I call that 'sand,'" he said quietly.  "Captain Arden, you
have my very best wishes.  I'm—scared of that Triangle.
It's got me jumpy—that's honest."  He had relapsed into his
old jerky style.  "It's bigger than I ever dreamed such a thing
could be.  Queer thing: sometimes I don't care, sometimes
I wish I could speak.  Probably you'll be killed; sometimes
I'm sorry, sometimes it doesn't seem to matter.  Yet I like
you extraordinarily.  Look an easy man to frighten?"
</p>

<p>
Storm viewed the splendid physique, seemingly unimpaired
by age, and his glance wandered to the masterful
poise of the big head on the broad shoulders.  He smiled as
he shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid," said Lord Hannassay with a grim
matter-of-factness that was more startling than any emotional
outburst.
</p>

<p>
"Is that serious?" Storm asked incredulously, and
Hannassay nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Same as you—I'd like to be out of it.  Sooner or later, I
think, I'll have to pay for my knowledge of it.  And yet, if I
placed that knowledge at your disposal, even on your assurance
that it would go no further, I should be little better off.
The Triangle is supremely callous—you understand that,
Captain Arden?  A human life—half a dozen, if you
like—<i>that</i>!"
</p>

<p>
He snapped his fingers contemptuously.  Storm concentrated
on blowing three smoke rings interlinked with
accurate symmetry.
</p>

<p>
"Who is Bulsaid?" he asked carelessly.
</p>

<p>
He had expected to create a sensation, and in this he was
not disappointed.  Hannassay froze into a rock-like immobility.
His pale blue eyes were like chips of ice, brittle and
glistening.
</p>

<p>
"Bulsaid," he whispered.
</p>

<p>
"Bulsaid—the man who was supplanted by Joe Blaythwayt
at school, whose mean little soul conceived even at that
age an undying hatred of those who passed him in the race.
Bulsaid, the man whom Sir John Marker beat at the
Clayston bye-election in March, 1897.  Bulsaid, the scientist
whose seriousness and anarchical views caused him to be
ragged rather unmercifully at Oxford, particularly by a
man named James Mattock—a man of good family but
with too much money, a popular, noisy, carefree youngster
whom Bulsaid came to add to the list of enemies his warped
mind never forgot.  Bulsaid, the man who has you, Lord
Hannassay, in his clutches, and who will perhaps never let
you go.  Bulsaid, the brilliant scholar, the fanatic, the
unforgiving hater, the embittered, half-mad genius—Hugo
Arden Bulsaid, my father!"
</p>

<p>
The Under Secretary said nothing, but the ramrod set
of his giant frame was now only superficial, for Storm saw
that the whole man was vibrant with tiny tremors.  Every
line on that stern, dominant face was graven deeper and
sterner, and little chips of hot steel glinted behind the icy
blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Hugo Arden Bulsaid," said Storm slowly, "the man
who made Oscar Raegenssen, and who will break him; the
man who'll kill me one day, if I don't kill him!"
</p>

<p>
"So you know," breathed Hannassay.  "And I needn't
have been so secretive about my knowledge."
</p>

<p>
He placed his thin cigar between his white teeth and
walked across to the window, whence he could look out on
the green beauty of Hyde Park dappled with the golden
glory of the morning sun.
</p>

<p>
"Yes....  I know," said Storm after a silence, and the
peer turned.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Arden," he said, "do you hate your father?"
</p>

<p>
Storm shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No—it's just the luck of the game."  He paused.  "But
you hate him."
</p>

<p>
"I hate him, I think, more than I had ever believed it was
possible to hate a man," said Hannassay with a cold gentleness
that was like the caress of vitriol.  "I hate him from the
ultimate depths of my soul.  I would kill him without
compunction and without fear this day ... but for one thing."
</p>

<p>
Storm pitched the stump of his cigarette into a flowerpot
and buttoned his coat.  In those trivial actions he
dispelled the tense gloom of the atmosphere as the dawning
sunshine breaks up the miasma of a swamp—it was a quality
born of his clean, fresh wholesomeness.
</p>

<p>
"I must be going," he said cheerily.  "Hope you have a
good holiday."
</p>

<p>
Lord Hannassay did not ring for the butler, but himself
escorted his guest to the door and opened it.  He held out his
hand and took Kit Arden's in a firm grip.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Au revoir</i>," said Storm, but Hannassay's head made a
slight, half-amused negative movement.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Adieu</i>," he said.  "A premonition, Captain Arden....
We shall never meet again....  Good-bye!"
</p>

<p>
Storm drove back to New Scotland Yard, and found the
indefatigable Teal waiting for him.  That stout detective
was working his jaws rhythmically, and a folded copy of the
morning paper was propped up on Storm's table before him,
while a litter of papers and printed forms of all colours
were spread across the blotter.
</p>

<p>
"There's a few notes you asked for," he remarked.  "I've
been looking through them."
</p>

<p>
He rose ponderously, and Storm took his place at the
desk.
</p>

<p>
"I can see somebody's been at them," said Storm gently,
and proceeded to attempt to restore order.  "Those files of
the <i>Record</i> arrived yet?"
</p>

<p>
"They're at the bottom."
</p>

<p>
Storm swept the chaos to one side and opened the package
which lay beneath.  Then he smoothed out the two
newspapers he found and began to skim methodically through
the pages.  It was some minutes before he found the passage
he had expected to find, and then the form of it was
entirely unsuspected.  It consisted of the book reviews, and
most of the space was occupied by criticisms of a certain
work.
</p>

<p>
"You read this, Teal," he observed after a while, "and
then tell Uncle Joe to give up literature as a career.  He's no
idea what budding authors have to put up with!"
</p>

<p>
The commentary was one of the most scathing Storm
had ever read.  At the head of it was the title <i>Devolution</i>, by
Hugo Bulsaid; and, a little lower down, appeared the name
of the reviewer—signed, as he had anticipated, John
Cardan.  There was one paragraph:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
We are, frankly, amazed that a firm of such standing as
Messrs.  Barry and Stokes should have suffered such a fit of
judicial aberration as to place on the market a work of such
incredible worthlessness.  We are equally astounded that a man
of such scientific prestige as Mr. Bulsaid should have wasted
his time in preparing it.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The article went on to discuss the worthlessness of the
book in detail, and, judging by the quotations from it with
which the remarks were interlarded, it seemed that there
was some excuse for the reviewer's violence.
</p>

<p>
"Anyone but Bulsaid would have started a libel action,"
Storm murmured.
</p>

<p>
The tirade concluded with these words:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
There is, we know, a great freedom allowed to the printed
word, but this freedom was originated that social problems
might be clearly and adequately discussed, and that reforms,
where necessary, might be suggested without fear.  It was not
granted in order that such works as "Devolution" might be
published.  "Devolution" is not only a degrading book; it is a
revolting book.  The subject is unclean, the theme might have
been adopted from the ravings of a lunatic, the treatment is of
a coarseness unrelieved by the faintest sparkle of wit or logic,
and to the mentality of the author can only be applied the
adjective "septic."  The only way in which one can regard this
work is as a joke—and then the joke is in such poisonous taste
that, one hopes, it would scarcely be tolerated in a Wapping
taproom.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Storm passed the sheet over to Teal, and the stolid
detective read it dispassionately.
</p>

<p>
"I hope you never read <i>Devolution</i>," Kit said when Teal
had finished.
</p>

<p>
"I was a respectably married man by that time," said
Mr. Teal virtuously.  "And, anyway, what sort of jokes don't
they tolerate in Wapping taprooms?  I've never been into
one—fat men didn't ought to drink."
</p>

<p>
"I seem to have heard that homily before," remarked
Storm.  "Anyway, not many people did read it—it was
withdrawn shortly after that review.  Here's the record."
</p>

<p>
He glanced through the second paper and finally folded
it down at a certain paragraph and passed it across the
desk.
</p>

<p>
"And yet it was all hot air," he said.  "I've made inquiries,
and as far as anyone can ascertain, Bulsaid led an impeccably
moral life both before and after he married.  I think
that book marks the beginning of his definite insanity.
Later, his madness turned into another channel, and
consequently became far less obvious."
</p>

<p>
He collected the scattered documents which he had pushed
aside, and began to run through them, classifying them as
he did so, and discarding those which did not bear directly
on his investigation.  Then he drew a clean sheet of paper
towards him and made some notes, and when he had
finished he called Teal over to study the result.
</p>

<p>
"I know all about Bulsaid," he said, speaking slowly
and quietly, as was his fashion when he was outlining his
thoughts aloud.  "But Bulsaid isn't the Triangle by any
means!  There are men in the Triangle who've been brought
in to serve the ends of the Triangle, but who've become its
masters.  Not openly—that's not what I mean.  But work's
got to be found for them, and money's got to be found for
them, or else they'll turn on their leader.  Bulsaid started the
Triangle, and now Bulsaid's the unconfessed slave of the
men he leads."
</p>

<p>
It was a curious thing that, although it was Teal, acting
on the suggestion of Joe Blaythwayt, who had revealed to
Storm the identity of his father, the relationship had never
since then been mentioned between them.
</p>

<p>
"Here's the list," said Storm, indicating the notes he
had made, "of the crook emigrants into this country, as
supplied to us by the American, French, and German police.
I'll bracket them off: Con men"—-he ticked one group with
his pencil—"yeggs ... whizzers ... knockers-off
... blackmailers ...  dope merchants ...  jewel thieves ... and so
forth and so on.  All the usual bunch who come over in the
season—and the numbers are about average.  But look at
these, who generally stay at home: eleven killers from
Germany; sixteen ditto from Paris, Toulon and Marseilles;
twenty-seven synthetic American gunmen.  That makes
fifty-four criminals who value the life of a man at
approximately two cents—-all in, or 'believed to be in,' London.
Tell me why, Teal!  Here's the report of the Chief of the
<i>Sûreté: 'Sans doute, quelqu'un a causé....</i>'  Sorry, you
don't talk the lingo, do you?
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"Undoubtedly, someone has been talking of the opportunities
which presents violent crime in England.  We have been
able to trace some of the movements of this unknown,
and we are convinced that his words have induced numbers
of our criminals to quit our shores.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
That's a literal translation.  In England, old Lafleuve means
that some coot's been touting for thugs!"  He turned over
other papers.  "Much the same from Germany.  New York
says:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"Knowing the rarity of violent crime in England, and the
efficiency of the police in suppressing such as exists, we beg to
suggest that you search for an organisation which contemplates
an attack on London which might easily have disastrous
consequences by reason of its very unexpectedness.  Our information
leads us to suspect the existence of some such organisation,
since there is abundant evidence of the persuasive suggestions
of some agent, whom we have been unable to trace and
identify, and since it is unlikely that men such as those we
name on the enclosed list would leave in a body without a
definite plan in mind.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="noindent">
Teal, who said respectability was dull?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll put through an all-station call for these men—you've
got the descriptions," said Teal conventionally.
</p>

<p>
Storm lighted a cigarette with a grace which he contrived
to make inexpressibly cynical.
</p>

<p>
"Put through all the calls you like," he said languidly.
"I'll bet you ten thousand bucks to half a secondhand
Limberger you don't get more than six of 'em that way!
Personally, I'm going to commit two felonies in the course
of the next forty-eight hours, and I'll guarantee to find out
more about the Triangle that way than you will in forty-eight
years with the help of the <i>Police News</i> and the <i>Weekly
List</i> and the rest of the bunch, and the whole dogstrung
C.I.D. into the bargain!"
</p>

<p>
He cast around for an excuse to ring up Susan, and, finding
none, called her number and hoped that the Lord would
provide.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course I'm all right," he said in answer to her
first question, and felt a pleasant tingle at the thought that
this should have been her initial interest.  "One reason I
rung up was to find out if you'd decided to accept Terry's
invitation to stay with them till Hannassay's back.  I wish
you would."
</p>

<p>
In the new spirit of selfishness that had come upon him
in the past few days, this was an inquiry of minor importance;
and yet, having made it, he was seriously concerned
about the reply he would receive.
</p>

<p>
"I have accepted it," she told him, and he was relieved.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like you to move in to-day," he said.  "I'm sorry if
that rushes you, but you've got to realise that there is a
certain amount of danger, and if you're killed or anything,
I shall get it in the neck.  I'll give Terry a ring, and he'll
come round and fix everything for you.  He loves work,"
added Storm mendaciously.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it can be managed," she said, for in spite of
his flippancy she recognised his determination, and knew
of old the futility of opposing him.  Also, when Storm gave
orders he had an uncanny knack of being always right.
</p>

<p>
"Do we lunch with Uncle Joe?" he teased her.
</p>

<p>
"I shall probably lunch with Mr. Mannering," she mocked
him back.  "No, really, I'm sorry you're in such a hurry for
me to move.  I wanted to go to Moraine's and see the jewels."
</p>

<p>
"What jewels?"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't you seen the papers?"
</p>

<p>
"Haven't had time yet, I usually breakfast in pyjamas,
if that personal detail interests you.  Getting up so early to
go out to breakfast spoilt my interest in the latest horrors
other people have been suffering!  I'll get hold of Terry
now—and I'll be round with him.  That boy wants watching!"
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver and took the paper from Teal's
hand.  The detective, with a perspicacity which indicated
that he had not turned a politely deaf ear to the telephone
conversation, had already found the place and folded the
sheet so as to display it.  It was an announcement that the
final instalment of the Russian Crown jewels were to be
sold by auction at Moraine's on the morrow, and would be
on view from ten to four on this particular day, and for
one day only.  The regalia had already been broken up, and
the stones alone, valued at something like four hundred
thousand pounds, would be sold.
</p>

<p>
"That's a lot of money," murmured Storm thoughtfully.
"Teal, get on the 'phone and find out how many men are
watching Moraine's."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal obeyed heavily, and in a few moments he had
the required information.  He cupped one hand over the
mouthpiece of the telephone and imparted the facts
without interest.
</p>

<p>
"Eight?" repeated Storm.  "That's a hell of a lot—I don't
think!  Tell 'em to turn out the reserves.  I want fifty men at
Moraine's in thirty minutes, and they've got to be armed!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
<br><br>
ROBBERY OVER ARMS
</h3>

<p>
"The car's in Cannon Row," said Storm, and led the way
down the stone stairs.
</p>

<p>
Just before they came into view from the street he
stopped in the corridor, fished out his cigarette case, and
selected a slender cylinder with elaborate care.
</p>

<p>
"I think I'm considered the most important, Teal," he
remarked.  "So you'll stand in the doorway while I go down
to the car—and you'll shoot first!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal nodded, and Storm lighted his cigarette as
calmly as though he was about to stroll out of a theatre
during the interval.  Then, with a gay wave of his hand to
the grim detective, he stepped out into the bright sunlight
and began to walk towards the Hirondel.
</p>

<p>
He fully expected that an attempt would be made on his
life, but the manner of it came as a complete surprise.  He
had covered half the distance when he heard a warning yell
from Teal, which, even in those circumstances, was unlike
that placid gentleman; for Inspector Teal was accounted
the best revolver shot in the Force.  An instinct that had lain
dormant since 1918 made him fling himself to the ground,
and as he did so Teal's gun cracked viciously.  Practically
on the instant, there came a detonation that surged
staggeringly, and clanged with savage force back from the stone
walls of the building.  Deafened and half-stunned, he sensed
dimly a chorus of shouts and one shrill scream, and
something hummed menacingly over his body.
</p>

<p>
Then he stumbled to his feet, mechanically brushing the
dust from his clothes.
</p>

<p>
In the roadway was a Thing which, presumably, had once
been a man.  Inspector Teal was coming imperturbably
towards him, pocketing his revolver with an air of duty well
done.  Further from the Thing were a couple of moaning
figures, around which a crowd was rapidly collecting....
</p>

<p>
"A Mills bomb," said Teal unemotionally.
</p>

<p>
Two men who had been passing at the time were terribly
injured, and an elderly lady was leaning against a
convenient lamp-post having hysterics.  Storm saw the
ambulance arrive and superintended the removal of the wounded
men, and then he made an inspection of the car.  It had been
between himself and the bursting bomb, and undoubtedly it
had saved his life.  The coachwork on one side was battered
and torn in great gaping holes, but, miraculously, the tires
and the engine had escaped.
</p>

<p>
He climbed in, lighted a fresh cigarette to replace the
one he had lost, and Teal followed him.
</p>

<p>
"Like to insure my life, Teal?" Storm murmured lightly.
"You might make enough to retire on in a few days."
</p>

<p>
"I'll go first next time, sir," said the sporting Mr. Teal,
and the two men solemnly shook hands.
</p>

<p>
Storm drove the car to Moraine's and affected a sublime
indifference to the curious glances which followed the
progress of the damaged relic of what had once been a glorious
shining Hirondel.
</p>

<p>
All the world knows Moraine's, the inconspicuous house
where priceless art treasures change hands, and the bidding
rises in thousands of pounds.  To Moraine's come the
wealthy connoisseurs and their resplendent wives, with a
small sprinkling of gaping sightseers, awing themselves
with the sight of so much concentrated wealth, and a few
optimistic ladies and gentlemen of irregular notions anent
the laws of property, whose dream it is that one day they
will arrange a coup on the premises.  That they do not is due
to the foresight of the architect who designed the showroom—a
lofty hall of glass and marble, roughly square in shape,
and set in the centre of the building, with no windows for
the cruder criminals to attempt to smash, too severely
furnished for the more nimble to find cover in at closing time,
too solidly built for the violent to break into with high
explosive.  It is a room of fearful silences, where every
whisper rings out like a clarion, and the intruder moves
delicately on the unpurchasable crimson carpet that hides
most of the tiled floor—for fear of offending the giant
flunkeys who stand statuesquely, one on each side of each
of the three portals (it would be sacrilege to describe these
masterpieces as "doors") in all the glory of their gold and
scarlet livery.
</p>

<p>
But Storm and Teal had small leisure to absorb all this
vision of magnificence.  Outside they had seen little knots
of variously dressed stalwart men standing chatting, men
who scarcely spared them a glance; or, if they did, gave no
sign of recognition.  Inside, grouped about the doors, were
similar men; and yet more moved unostentatiously about
the room, peering idly at the glittering gems displayed
in the long glass case that ran down the centre of the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Four hundred thousand pounds," said Storm.  "Teal,
wouldn't you sell your soul for the brains of the Triangle!"
</p>

<p>
Among the crowd Mr. Teal caught sight of an old friend,
and flowed irresistibly towards him.  The friend so
recognised suddenly remembered an urgent appointment elsewhere,
but the vast form of the detective effectively barred
his path.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Birdie," he drawled.  "How's trade?"
</p>

<p>
"You're making a mistake, Mr. Teal," said the little
man with dignity.  "I'm an honest man.  Them jools"—he
jerked a contemptuous thumb in the direction of the
showcase—"them jools are beautiful, but my interest is solely
that of the connosewer."
</p>

<p>
Birdie Sands was playing his "gentleman act," a device
he adopted automatically when accused of anything.
Mr. Teal, however, remained unimpressed.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, Birdie, you naughty, wicked man!" he said
genially, "I won't believe you've degenerated that much.
Not when you see as much of Snooper as you do.  What
does the Good Book say?  'Snooper finds some mischief still
for Birdie Sands to do.'  Birdie, go home!"
</p>

<p>
"As a lore-abiding citizen an' a man of edjucation,"
Birdie began haughtily—but Teal was in no mood for
wasting time.
</p>

<p>
He signed to one of the "connosewers" who was loafing
near by, and a protesting Birdie was taken gently but firmly
by the arm and conducted towards the open air.  Following
which Teal, with intent to continue his clean-up, looked
around him for a fresh victim.
</p>

<p>
He never accomplished his ambition.
</p>

<p>
Startlingly loud above the hushed whispering of the
crowd a voice rang out in a curt command:
</p>

<p>
"Everybody will now stand perfectly still and keep
silence!"
</p>

<p>
Teal swung round, his hand moving instinctively to his
hip.  It stayed abruptly, for he saw the means there were for
enforcing the order.  At one end of the room stood six men,
in line, their right hands held high above their heads.  And in
every one of those hands was something round and black
and shining.
</p>

<p>
"Shades of Mills!" breathed Teal.
</p>

<p>
The leader spoke again:
</p>

<p>
"These are Mills bombs.  The pins are out, and at the
first sign of resistance they will be thrown.  Also, if any one
of us is shot, his bomb will, of course, explode when he
falls.  Please be sensible.  We do not wish to shed blood
unnecessarily."
</p>

<p>
The detectives, uncertain, looked to Storm for their cue.
He only hesitated for a second, and then he gave them their
instructions in a clear voice.
</p>

<p>
"You will all obey that order.  Carry on, Gat!"
</p>

<p>
Three of the men handed their bombs to their companions
and moved towards the glass cases.  The other three, now
holding a bomb in each hand, stood motionless.
</p>

<p>
"Everybody will now move down to the far end of the
room," said Gat Morini.  "The officers of the law, except
Mr. Teal and Captain Arden, will be at the back of the
crowd.  If a bomb has to be thrown, I should dislike having
to hurt any policemen or any of my assistants."
</p>

<p>
Storm, standing well to the front, was coolly lighting a
cigarette.  That amazing young man was smiling, and the
hand that held the match was coldly steady as an iceberg.
He looked at Teal, and found that the detective was flushed
and shaking with rage.  Teal's vanity was an unsuspected
tender spot, and there was no doubt that the barefaced
effrontery of the gang in so holding up a squad of detectives
was likely to strike him with apoplexy.
</p>

<p>
"Can't anything be done, sir?" he pleaded unsteadily.
"There's about thirty armed men behind us, and we're
helpless!"
</p>

<p>
"And there's about sixty civilians, male and female,"
Storm told him, "who'll get where the bottle got the cork
if we start any funny stuff and bombs go flying about!  And
they will throw 'em—you can invest your hosiery in that!"
</p>

<p>
Teal shook his head despondently.
</p>

<p>
"This'll be the end of both of us," he said.  "What in
hell's happened to those dear friends outside?"
</p>

<p>
He did not say "dear friends."
</p>

<p>
Storm shrugged.  A bag had been produced, and the three
men in the centre of the room were gathering up the jewels
and packing them quickly and carefully away.  One by one
they emptied the cases, and the bag grew heavy and bulging.
They were working on the last case when an interruption
occurred.  One of the guards from the street came to the
entrance.
</p>

<p>
The whole thing was perfectly planned.  The three
unarmed men hardly looked up from their task.  One of those
who held bombs turned with one arm threateningly drawn
back as the detective, swiftly comprehending the scene,
made a swift movement of his right hand.  The other two
continued to menace the crowd huddled together at the far
end of the room.
</p>

<p>
"Don't shoot!" rapped Storm, and the man's hand fell
to his side.
</p>

<p>
He was passed back to his comrades behind the crowd
of frightened men and women, and the despoiling of the
last case went on without a break.  The Triangle had allowed
for all contingencies, and every counter-move had been
designed and rehearsed to perfection, so that the complete
performance should move as cleanly and slickly as an
exhibition by a perfectly trained <i>corps de ballet</i>.
</p>

<p>
It was all carried out with incredible speed and efficiency.
Barely five minutes elapsed between the first intimation of
the attack and the collection of every gem in the place in the
bag the three operatives carried.
</p>

<p>
In the forefront of the crowd a keen-faced young man
was writing swiftly in a notebook.  His astounding
unconcern stamped him immediately as a member of the only
profession which would be detachedly interested in the end
of the world.
</p>

<p>
Snooper Brome replaced the pins in the bombs he held,
and one of his assistants did the same.  The third man still
held up his hands with their load of concentrated death.
The three who had rifled the cases left first, strolling out
one by one and conversing casually of what they had seen.
Morini, carrying the bag, paused to deliver a mocking
farewell.
</p>

<p>
"We shall meet again, Captain Arden," he said.
</p>

<p>
"In the Old Bailey," brisked Storm cheerfully.  "So long,
Gat."
</p>

<p>
He had no fear of being attacked then, for obviously the
gang would be unwilling to alarm the people outside if it
could be avoided.  The whole thing was staked on the
handicap of the crowd of people who would be involved in the
fight if the police made a move.  It was the most consummately
daring bluff in the history of crime, and, granted
police officers who felt responsibility for the safety of the
general public, it was a bluff that could not be called....
</p>

<p>
Now only the last man was left, and he stood like a
graven image while the hands of the big clock on the wall
over his head moved slowly.  A silence had fallen on the
crowd, and the only sound was the restless movements of
their feet.  The reporter was still writing dispassionately.
</p>

<p>
And then, without the quiver of a nerve, Storm performed
an act of reckless heroism that drew a great gasp
from the crowd.  He threw away the butt of his cigarette,
and reached boredly to his pocket.  Those who were near
him saw something hard and blue-black leap out with his
hand....
</p>

<p>
He fired, and as he fired he hurled himself forward, The
man with the bombs sagged and crumpled with a little
choking cry.  Storm was upon him even before he fell, had
wrenched the bombs from the spastic clutch of the dead
hands, and was racing towards the door.  Beyond that door
was a long marble corridor which led to the vaults wherein
the treasures offered for sale at Moraine's were stored at
night.  With a grunt he flung the two bombs far from him
and jerked himself back into the room.
</p>

<p>
They detonated in mid-air, and he was only just in time
to avoid the fragments of metal that came whizzing back
on the earth-shaking reverberation.  The tense effort left
him gasping weakly, and the screams of panicking men
and women came to him through a red haze.  But it was
only for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Attaboy!"  His cheery voice rose above the pandemonium.
"Three shies a penny—<i>after 'em, you hounds of
Hell!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The detectives, led by Teal, poured out of the other door
which led to the street, and were met by the inrush of the
outside guards who had heard the explosion.  Storm watched
them go, and then went towards the fighting, stampeding
mass of people who were striving to follow them.  At a
glance he saw that the flying splinters of the bombs had
done no physical damage, and he let his parade-ground
voice go like a whip crack.  He cursed and insulted them into
silence, and barked them back into the room.
</p>

<p>
"You poor henripped sheep!" he snapped when he had
cowed them into some sort of order.  "There'll be no more
fireworks.  Form single rank, all ladies to the right, and
go out quietly—not like a lot of milling white rabbits!"
</p>

<p>
He marched them out like a string of beaten dogs.  Only
one protested at this assumption of command, and he was
a man whom Storm had marked down in the stampede—a
gross, expensively dressed bounder, white and shaking
with terror, who had striven to claw his way to safety
through a mob of frightened women.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have the coat off your back, sir!" he fumed, his
voice shrill with the reaction from fear.  "You—you—you
insolent young puppy, swearing at us as if we were the
scum of the earth!  I'll report you to your chief!  I'll have
you kicked out of the Force!  You're a disgrace to the police,
sir—a disgrace!  You—you endanger our lives, and then
you have the—the impertinence—the impertinence—I demand
to know your name, sir!  I shall go straight to Scotland Yard!"
</p>

<p>
"I am Captain Arden," said Storm coldly, and his lip
curled.  "Ask for Mr. Kennedy, who is my chief.  And put
a cushion in the seat of your trousers before you go,
because he will quite certainly kick you down the stairs."
</p>

<p>
"I'll write to the papers about this outrage!" stormed
the man.  "I'll have you pilloried in the Press!  I'll—I'll——"
</p>

<p>
"I'll tie you in three knots and push you under an omnibus
if you aren't outside in five seconds," said Storm quietly,
and there was such concentrated scorn in his voice that the
man shrank away as though he expected a blow.
</p>

<p>
Storm was boiling with suppressed rage beneath his calm
exterior, for the events of the past minutes had frayed his
nerves more than he would ever have admitted.  The reporter
had watched the scramble with half-closed, amused
eyes, and had gracefully taken his place at the end of the
queue when peace was restored.  He was the last to leave,
and he held out his hand as he came to the door.
</p>

<p>
"I won't ask for an interview," he said, "because I don't
want my head bitten off before I've written up this scoop.
Here's my card.  I'll see you through if that cow in trousers
makes a fuss."
</p>

<p>
Storm's acid stare dissolved into a smile in response to
the youngster's grin, and he shook hands heartily.  They
went out into the street together, and shouldered their way
through the mass of excited people who had assembled.  A
uniformed man answered Storm's query.
</p>

<p>
"Your men are after them, sir, but I don't think they've
much chance.  I saw them all go, and they looked too
innocent to be wrong; besides, there'd been no alarm."
</p>

<p>
Storm started up the Hirondel and the journalist, without
invitation, joined him.  Storm drove him back to Fleet
Street and returned to Scotland Yard.  He was feeling
annoyed, for he had risked everything to allow the detectives
to give chase with the least possible delay, and yet he knew
the futility of attempting to allow even two minutes' start
in London to a fast car whose number was unknown; and
he did not doubt for one moment that the gang had provided
themselves with every possible means of ensuring a
good getaway.
</p>

<p>
Newsboys were rushing about with sensational posters
in their hands, yelling indistinguishable captions, but he
hardly noticed them.  He had occasion to remember them,
however, when he reached his room, for a letter was
awaiting him and it was marked URGENT.  He tore it open, and
found a sheet of thin foolscap covered with neat writing.
At the head of it was drawn the symbol of the Alpha
Triangle, and just below this was a note:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
A copy of this Manifesto has been sent to all the London
newspapers, and all News Agencies.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Then came the lines of writing headed in a way that was
more audacious than any criminal proclamation—of which
a few are issued from time to time, but of which nobody
takes any notice—he had ever read.  And the subject-matter
of the manifesto would only a week ago have excited his
derision.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
FIRST MANIFESTO
</p>

<p class="t3">
  <i>by the Lord of the Alpha Triangle, in Council, to the Parliament<br>
  and People of the United Kingdom.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter2">
WHEREBY it is announced as follows:
</p>

<p class="letter2">
The Society at present known as the Alpha Triangle is the
most powerful and the most highly-organised Institution
of its kind the world has ever known.  The Society is
composed of those who, recognising the fact that Force
is the law of Nature, and that the principles obtaining in
International Politics are those which should have
currency in Social Politics, have arranged to extract from
the World the wealth which they desire by such means
as they think fit to employ.  Recognising, also, that they
are declaring a War upon the Laws of the World, the
Alpha Triangle wish it to be understood that no human
life will be sacred to them during the duration of such
a War.
</p>

<p class="letter2">
IN ORDER, therefore, that much needless sacrifice of life
may be saved, the Alpha Triangle takes this opportunity
of announcing that it will declare an End of this War on
receiving official Intimation of the acceptance by His
Majesty's Government of the following Terms of Peace:
</p>

<p class="letter2">
(1) THAT the Government above cited shall, within two
months of the date hereof, pay to the Alpha Triangle the
sum of £15,000,000 (Fifteen million pounds).
</p>

<p class="letter2">
(2) THAT the Government above cited shall, upon making
this payment, utter a proclamation freely pardoning the
several members of the Alpha Triangle and fully
indemnifying them from the results of any civil or criminal
proceedings in connection with any felonies, misdemeanours
or torts committed by the said members of the
Alpha Triangle, up to and including the day upon which
this payment is made.
</p>

<p class="letter2">
(3) THAT the Government above cited shall make this
payment in gold ingots, in a manner to be described
upon our receipt of the notification of the said
Government that they accept these Terms without any
reservation or alteration whatsoever.
</p>

<p class="letter2">
AND WHEREAS it is expedient that these Terms shall be
complied with without delay, we further announce that
until the aforesaid notification of acceptance shall be
received by us through the medium of the Daily Press,
we shall at intervals of three days inclusive assassinate
the undermentioned members of the Cabinet:—
</p>

<p class="letter2">
        Sir John Marker (Home Secretary).<br>
  Hugh Anderby Neilson (Chancellor of the Exchequer).<br>
  Paul Hesketh (Foreign Secretary).<br>
  Lester Hume Smith (Secretary for War)<br>
  Lord Hannassay.<br>
  John Bayridge-Rand.<br>
</p>

<p class="letter2">
AND IN ADDITION, the criminal activities of the Alpha
Triangle will continue with unabated energy.  Of the
efficiency of these activities the Public will be in
possession of a striking example by the time this Manifesto
appears in print.
</p>

<p class="letter2">
FURTHER BE IT KNOWN that the lives of those who
set themselves to track down the Alpha Triangle are
forfeit, and this sentence will be first carried out upon
the persons of Captain Christopher Arden and Inspector
Claud Eustace Teal.
</p>

<p class="letter2">
  GIVEN by our Hand this Day,<br>
        (Signed)
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
For signature there was simply a small replica of the
crest which commenced the sheet.
</p>

<p>
Storm read the rambling, arrogant proclamation through
again, taking in all its pseudo-legal jargon, unnecessary
capitals, and peculiar paragraphing.  It was an amazing
announcement, and yet he absorbed every word of it eagerly,
for even though it was undoubtedly the work of a madman
he had already had enough evidence that the madman had
the brain of a genius and the organising ability to carry
through his extravagant threats.  And the men were there
to serve him—the half-human, brutal, remorseless dregs
of four or five nations, who would kill for him readily....
One thing only amused him, and he spoke of it to Inspector
Teal when the plump detective arrived.
</p>

<p>
"You've discovered my guilty secret," said Mr. Teal
sadly.  "If I was on the staff of the Triangle, I'd have put
the name of the man who suggested those names to my
father on the list."
</p>

<p>
There was a silence.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"It's incredible!" Storm said harshly.  "Teal, if your
pal Joe put this manifesto into his book every critic would
tear it to pieces.  And yet it's true!  It's possible!  A bughouse
genius with an army of cheap thugs who'll obey him—this"—he
tapped the paper—"this don't count a blue hoot!  It
only proves he's mad, and I knew that already.  And God
knows how to stop him.  I know the Triangle, and I could
arrest him in thirty minutes, but what court'd convict on
all the evidence I've got?"
</p>

<p>
Teal shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"The Moraine's men got clean away—we hadn't an
earthly."  He fumbled in his pocket and drew out a pink
slip.  "This might interest you," he said casually, and
strolled away to the window.
</p>

<p>
Storm read the telegram, and as he read he went cold.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
<br><br>
ANNOYANCE OF OSCAR
</h3>

<p class="letter">
Nothing but credit can attach to Captain Arden, who is in
charge of the case.  Immediately he heard of the display of
jewels, he ordered fifty officers in plain clothes to be armed and
dispatched to Moraine's.  The hold-up, however, was staged in
a manner so unprecedented and so completely unforseen that,
hampered as they were by a considerable number of sightseers,
Captain Arden and his men were helpless.  As it was, his
prompt action in attacking the member of the gang who was
left behind to ensure the getaway of the others was as courageous
a deed as that which won him the D.S.O. at Mons during
the Great War.  It was not his fault that he failed to prevent
the escape of the gang.  Captain Arden also deserves special
praise for the way in which he quelled the subsequent panic.
A gentleman who was present has written us a strongly worded
letter abusing the methods used by Captain Arden in doing
this.  Our correspondent apparently fails to realise that you
cannot argue politely with a terrified mob, and that Captain
Arden's vigorous measures probably saved several people
from, at least, serious injury.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
So spoke the <i>Daily Record</i>, after the first profitable crime
of the Triangle.
</p>

<p>
The trouble about sensational crime, from the journalist's
point of view, is that once the public has ceased to be
interested in its committal, the news value falls several
degrees below par.  The Triangle mystery, however, suffered
from no such disadvantages.  The definite threat of further
crimes effectively maintained popular interest at fever heat.
The Triangle was the topic of conversation wherever two
or three were gathered together, and those who at the first
announcement had dismissed it as a hoax, prayed that their
indiscretion might be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
Joe Blaythwayt was confidently pessimistic.
</p>

<p>
"I Know Criminals," he would say darkly, to the few
doubters that remained.
</p>

<p>
Another man, personally concerned with the fate of the
plot, was belligerently smug.
</p>

<p>
"I shall nod bay," he repeated with liturgical monotony.
</p>

<p>
He sat opposite Joe Blaythwayt in the Lombard Street
office.  It was not his usual day for calling, but his reason
was costly enough to justify this departure from routine.
</p>

<p>
"Ter day afder to-morrow," he said, "I shall a cheque
traw vor fifty tousand bounds.  I shall require to pe baid in
one bound notes.  Led berbarations pe mate."
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, sir," said Joe Blaythwayt briskly, and made
a note on his pad.  "The money will be ready for you.  In the
morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Yess!"  Raegenssen nodded violently.  "That iss all.
Thang you."
</p>

<p>
He rose.
</p>

<p>
"If I might mention something, sir," Blaythwayt stopped
him.  "That man Snooper—you want to be careful of him."
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen wrinkled.
</p>

<p>
"Snoober?"
</p>

<p>
"That Brome fellow—Edward Brome he calls himself.
I saw him driving through the City in your car yesterday
morning.  Of course, it's really no business of mine if
you give your acquaintance a lift, but Brome
isn't—ah—desirable.  He's a well-known fence."
</p>

<p>
"Fence?"
</p>

<p>
"'Fence,'" explained Mr. Blaythwayt with unction, "is
the cant term among criminals for a man who buys stolen
property.  A receiver.  Brome is a receiver."
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen stroked his chin.
</p>

<p>
"Tear me!  That iss most disdressing—yess!  Hof you
seen him before?  How do you know?"
</p>

<p>
"I Know Criminals," said Joe with an air.
</p>

<p>
"When you again meed him," said Raegenssen seriously,
"dell him nod to gall on me again.  I shall pe gross—yess!  A
griminal!  I shall eggsdinguish him!  He shall hof ter fire
out!"
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt was surprised at the man's vehemence.
</p>

<p>
"There's no actual evidence against him," he explained
erroneously, "but the police know him for a criminal and
they're anxious to get a conviction."  In this he was nearer
the truth.  "It'd be unpleasant for you to be known as a
friend of Snooper's.  I thought I'd take the liberty of
warning you."
</p>

<p>
The Swede nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I am gradeful.  Thang you.  Goot-pye!"
</p>

<p>
He left in his usual abrupt manner, and Joe Blaythwayt
returned to his desk with a comfortable feeling of having
at last found an opportunity of giving a practical
demonstration of his knowledge of the criminal classes.
</p>

<p>
So escaped Snooper Brome, with three car-loads of
detectives all but on his heels and four hundred thousand
pounds' worth of gems in a shabby leather bag.  And the
armed men who prowled the streets of London searched in
vain.
</p>

<p>
That evening, Oscar Raegenssen summoned his portly
butler and his chauffeur to his study.  He took the cocktail
the butler shook for him, and threw two buff scraps of
paper on the table.
</p>

<p>
"To-night," he ordered, "you will go to der theadrigal
enderdainments.  Your tiggets!  I do not wiss to disturbed
pe!"
</p>

<p>
His servants accepted the tickets with murmured thanks,
and exchanged a covert wink, for they were used to their
master's eccentricities.  Without warning or explanation he
would disappear for weeks, and return, as though he had
only been absent for a day, expecting to find everything
running smoothly for him to drop back into.  Often he sent
them away for the night, with some such instructions as he
gave them now.  They put their own constructions on these
habits of his, and they were quite wrong.
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen saw them out of the house, and then fetched
a hat and stick and himself left.  He dined economically at a
small restaurant in Soho, and from there he went on to the
Orpheum Theatre, where that bright entertainment <i>Bronx
or Manhattan</i> played nightly to crowded houses.  Not that
Oscar Raegenssen was interested in snappy back-chat,
negroid music, or chorus girls' legs; but the box of a theatre
is a convenient place for meeting those whom you wish to
see and speak with in private.  There Storm, who was in the
stalls, saw him dozing boredly during the first part of the
show, for Oscar Raegenssen's friend was not due to arrive
until ten.
</p>

<p>
Storm left in the interval, and strolled leisurely to the
garage where his car was kept.  He drove north and
west—along Oxford Street and up Orchard Street, and when
the gates of Regent's Park loomed before him he veered
half left and went on up the Finchley Road.  After a
distance he turned right, drove on for about three hundred
yards, and suddenly swung left into an unlighted track.
The car bumped and jolted as he nursed it over the uneven
ground.
</p>

<p>
At length he stopped, switched off all his lights, got down,
and stretched himself.
</p>

<p>
The moon was new and feeble, and the sky black with
hurrying clouds.  Somewhere to the north rumbled the
mutter of distant thunder, A summer storm was brewing.
</p>

<p>
He disappeared among the shadows.  The darkness was
almost complete, yet he picked his way over the rough path
unerringly.  On either side of him rose ghostly polyliths
which resembled ruins in that faint light, and once he
climbed over a wall in the interstices of which the cement
was still soft.  He was on a plot of land where a block of
flats was being erected.
</p>

<p>
Presently he stopped and took a black silk handkerchief
from his pocket, and this he pinned to the lapels of his
dinner jacket.  It erased the white blur of his shirt and made
him practically invisible.  A second black silk handkerchief,
folded diagonally, he tied about the lower part of his face.
</p>

<p>
A six-foot wall barred his way.  He scaled it like a cat,
and dropped nimbly on the springy turf on the other side.
</p>

<p>
The house stood back from the road, in darkness.  Storm
was in the back garden, the high walls that enclosed it
screening him effectively from the view of any possible outside
watchers.  He stole along in the shadow they cast.  A car
passed with a hoot and a blare as the latch of a window
clicked open under his expert manipulation, and as the
splutter of the car died away he raised the sash soundlessly
and slipped over the sill.
</p>

<p>
Inside, the blackness was intense, with a tangible quality
to it that was numbing to the senses.  Myriads of silver
specks whirled before the eyes in protest against the strain
of attempted vision.  The utter opacity was tactile, half
fluid, like a fog.  He crept through the room with a feline
assurance, uncannily avoiding chairs and tables, crossed the
hall, and opened a door on the far side, closing it behind
him.  Then he went over to the window and passed his
sensitive fingers delicately over every inch of it, even as he had
done to that by which he had entered—a touch light enough
to stroke a butterfly's wing unfelt.  Satisfied that there were
no alarms fitted, he pressed back the catch and opened the
window to its fullest extent, after which he drew the heavy
curtains.
</p>

<p>
A beam of light stabbed the darkness, flickered over
every part of the room, and rested at length on a Sheraton
cabinet.
</p>

<p>
Unhurriedly he made his preparations.  From an inside
pocket he took a paper bag from which he scattered a coarse
powder over the exposed parquet by the door, so that anyone
attempting to enter would be bound to step on it.  Next
came a slim wallet of morocco leather which, laid open on
the floor beside the cabinet, gleamed with the silvery sheen
of fine steel tools.  Lastly, he drew from his hip pocket an
automatic pistol, and this he also laid on the floor beside
him.
</p>

<p>
The cabinet hid a small safe of the most modern type,
built like a battleship, yet he tackled it confidently.  Patiently
and skillfully he worked, and at last he had a rubber cup
fixed securely to the metal about the lock.  Into this he
poured a viscid liquid from a rubber bottle, which he handled
gingerly.  Then he sat back on his heels, while the
concentrated acid bubbled against the steel and gave off a
heavy, pungent vapour.
</p>

<p>
Exactly three hours after he had entered the house the
door of the safe hung open, disclosing rows and rows of
documents tied in bundles of various sizes, neatly arranged
on the metal shelves.
</p>

<p>
Holding the electric lamp between his knees so that its
rays fell towards the floor, he ran through the packets
rapidly.
</p>

<p>
It was then that he heard the snap of potassium chlorate—the
safety powder he had sprinkled around the door detonated
under foot like the tiny explosions of "cap" pistols.
He caught up his automatic and spun around, just as a
switch clicked over and the room was flooded with a
blinding glare.
</p>

<p>
For a space of seconds there was a strung, pulsating
silence.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Snooper," said Storm, in a voice that was not
his own.  "How are things?"
</p>

<p>
It was a deadlock.  Snooper Brome's big hand held an
ugly revolver which covered Storm, and Storm's little
automatic was steadily focused on Mr. Brome's rainbow
waistcoat.  So they stood without movement, with every nerve
keyed and strained to humming pitch, while their eyes never
swerved a fraction of a millimetre from each other's
trigger finger.  Moments passed with the glittering clarity of
crystal drops falling in a bottomless pit....
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing?" asked Mr. Brome, though the
question was rather unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
He looked pale, and his mane of black hair was more
unruly than usual.
</p>

<p>
"I might ask the same question," remarked Storm.
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met over the blue-black gleam of their
weapons—Storm's glinting metallically over his improvised
mask, Snooper's blue ones cold and level.  And Storm saw
Snooper's first finger whiten over the knuckle ... saw the
slight backward tremble of the hammer of his revolver.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be a fool!" he snapped tensely.  "An automatic's
quicker than an uncocked revolver.  I can shoot a fraction of
a second before you can, and I never miss!"
</p>

<p>
Snooper's finger relaxed, and the masked man rose
slowly from his crouching position.
</p>

<p>
"That's why you'll drop that gat," went on Storm's
monotonous, unrecognisable voice.  It was perfectly level, and
yet he was playing the most terrific gamble of nerve in his
career.  He was banking, betting, coldly and unruffledly
threatening on the infinitesimal margin of time's advantage
the difference of weapons gave him.  "You're poaching,
Snooper.  Your business is to fence, not to crack cribs
yourself ... taking the bread out of the poor burglar's mouth....
I shall have to report you to the Larcenists' Union,
Snooper, really I shall...."
</p>

<p>
His voice trailed away.
</p>

<p>
Brome slackened the muscles of his forearm preparatory
to making his own gamble, for he knew how desperate
was his position.  And yet he need not have been afraid,
for Storm had taken one of those swift, inspirational,
entirely characteristic decisions of his.  But, not knowing this,
Eddie Brome watched keenly for the faintest wavering of
the gun-metal grey eyes....  He stirred slightly, and the
<i>crack!</i> of another speck of potassium chlorate under his foot
was like a gunshot in the stillness.
</p>

<p>
For a decimal of a split second it distracted his attention.
</p>

<p>
A fine tongue of flame licked out from the muzzle of
Storm's automatic, and the roar of the explosion was
shattering.  The bullet struck Brome's revolver from his hand,
and it clattered to the floor while his arm fell limply to his
side, suddenly paralysed by the shock.
</p>

<p>
Storm dropped his gun into his pocket and leapt.  His
fist crashed into Snooper's face, and the big man slid limply
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Storm had his back to the drawn curtains, and behind
him he heard, quite distinctly, a stifled gasp.  In one lightning
spring he was beside the window, his back flattened against
the wall, watching and listening.  No one entered, and he
drew back the edge of the curtain a centimetre.  There was
nothing to be seen, but as he let the cloth fall back he
caught the gentle crunch of stealthy footsteps on gravel.
</p>

<p>
He was across the room in a flash, had turned out the
lights, and was back at the window.  He slipped between the
curtains and swung himself out, dropping to the path with
hardly a sound.  At the corner of the building a dim grey
shape moved suddenly and vanished.
</p>

<p>
Storm jumped the path and raced along the turf to where
he had seen the figure.  There was no sign of it, but he could
glimpse the small area in front of the house, and he saw the
two black burly forms which pounded up the tiled approach,
their lanterns dancing as they ran.
</p>

<p>
"Damn these police....  But it's no use getting rattled,
Horace!" he murmured.
</p>

<p>
With which sound piece of philosophy he doubled back
to the window and returned to the room he had left.  His
one shot had already raised the alarm, and he had much to
do, yet he moved without flurry.  On the floor in front of the
safe he continued his interrupted task by the light of his
torch.  It was finished in a few moments, and then he closed
the safe and replaced the wallet of tools in his pocket.  As he
crossed to the door he saw that Snooper had vanished and,
on the strength of his decision, was glad that he had not
hit the fence harder.
</p>

<p>
There was, however, small time for these reflections, for
the constables outside were already thundering on the front
door.  He flitted upstairs like a shadow, temporarily
unperturbed by the problem of how he was to escape, and made
a speedy, methodical search of all the upstairs rooms.  The
door of one remained shut when he turned the handle
noiselessly, and from within came a faint sound of cautious
movement.
</p>

<p>
Coolly he twisted into the next room, and, looking out
and down, he saw the policemen climb in through the
window he had left open for his own bolt-hole.
</p>

<p>
"Jerusalem!" he breathed.  "They've both gone in—the
poor, damned boobs!  I ought to take their numbers, really,
and report them for incompetence....  However...."
</p>

<p>
He flung a leg over the sill and looked up, for although
his way of escape was temporarily clear he was anxious to
see the man in the adjoining room.  Above his head ran a
stout gutter, and, testing it with his weight, he decided that
it would hold.  He swung out into space and risked his way
along the side of the building.  In a few hair-raising seconds
he could see into one corner of the lighted room, and then
a loose section of pipe rattled in his hand, and the blind
whirred down almost in his face.
</p>

<p>
Without hesitation he turned and made his way as
swiftly as he dared back to the window he had left.  He got
his legs inside, and then grabbed the top of the sash and
wrenched his body down and inwards with all his strength.
Even as he did so, the shot he had feared and sought thus
to dodge rang out, and something seared across his
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Here—none of that, sir!" commanded a voice, and the
next instant the lights went up.
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen stood on the threshold, cold murder flaming
in his eyes.  Behind him were the two constables, holding
him back, and one of them was clutching the Swede's wrist
to prevent him firing the second round he was wrestling
and straining to loose off.  He was in evening dress, with his
mane of fair hair dishevelled and his Viking beard awry
with the struggle.
</p>

<p>
"Take that man!" he screamed, and one of the constables
released his hold and came towards Storm.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me," murmured Storm.  "Siegfried, my Pelican,
you seem annoyed!"
</p>

<p>
His hand went to his pocket, and whipped into view
again immediately with a vision of snarling death.  He fired
in between the men until the magazine was exhausted, and
for a moment they recoiled instinctively.  It gave him his
chance.  With a light laugh he leapt for the little group in
the doorway.
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen staggered back from the sideways smash of
Storm's elbow, and in the same movement Storm hit one
of the policemen regretfully but scientifically on the point
of the jaw.  An instant later he was sprinting down the
passage.
</p>

<p>
He sprang to the banisters, and went whirling down, as
the Swede fired again.  The bullet sang harmlessly past
Storm's head, and a whistle shrilled urgently.  The three
men came stumbling down in his wake, but he had the start
of them, and he had ducked back into the shadows of the
hall and vanished into the library before they could switch
on the downstairs lights.  They were still groping about
when he passed through the still open window and scudded
across the back lawn the way he had come.
</p>

<p>
He found his car, stripped off his disguise, and had his
hand on the door when he noticed that there was someone
huddled up in the front seat.  He glanced keenly around him,
and then kept his right hand on the gun in his pocket as he
turned his electric flash on the face of the intruder.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Kit," said Susan calmly,
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
When he had disposed of the police Raegenssen collected
the papers from his safe and studied each one of them
closely.  Then he replaced them and went to the kitchen at
the back of the house, where he brewed himself some coffee,
and, armed with this, returned to the library and lighted a
cigar.
</p>

<p>
Half-way through the smoke he discarded the stump
fastidiously and rose.  At one end of the room was a small
writing-desk, which he unlocked, drawing down the folding
front.  Then he took off his coat and white waistcoat and
began to work.
</p>

<p>
A tiny reading-lamp on the top of the desk was all the
light in the room.  He looked a grotesque figure, his leonine
head stooped over his work, his glasses perched precariously
on the end of his nose, his protruding tongue following the
movements of his hands, with the direct light bringing out
his angular face in high relief.
</p>

<p>
It was two hours later that he heard the sound—the creak
of a board under a wary foot.  He laid down his stylo
carefully and switched out the reading-lamp.  On the threshold
of the library he halted.  The hall was in darkness.  Facing
him, though he could not see them, were three doors, and
he had left each one of them slightly ajar.  Almost certainly
his study would be the goal of this new trespasser, he
decided, and passed over the heavy carpet without sound.  He
was just outside the study door when he heard a curious
noise—three deliberate claps.  It was so obviously designed
to attract attention that another man would have paused,
but Raegenssen was a man without fear.  He slid through
the opening and stood with his back to the wall, every sense
on the alert.
</p>

<p>
"Who iss that?" he demanded.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to know?" boomed back a mocking
voice.
</p>

<p>
It was disguised, yet there was something familiar in it
which he could not place.  His searching fingers located
the electric light switch, but he flicked the lever over and
back without results.  The wires were cut—he found the
loose ends hanging free a foot further down.
</p>

<p>
"What is...?" he said.
</p>

<p>
And then came a rollicking chuckle that, unemotional as
he was, seemed to set a fine thread of ice vibrating in his
spine.
</p>

<p>
"Maddock!" he roared uncertainly, and then he saw a
shadow move, and stumbled forward.
</p>

<p>
He touched cloth, and with a deep-throated grunt he
closed.  The unknown struck at him with something that
whistled as it fell, but Raegenssen bowed his head and the
life-preserver thudded agonisingly into his shoulder instead
of into his skull.  He grabbed the striker's hand, and for a
short while they swayed and panted in the darkness.  His
opponent was heavy and strong above the average, but he
was no match for the giant Swede.  Presently they fell
together, and Raegenssen heaved himself astride the writhing
man and sought to gather in the arms that struck viciously
at him.
</p>

<p>
"Now we shall see," he growled, and then a chance blow
crashed into his solar plexus and he rolled limply away,
gasping in a torment of nausea.
</p>

<p>
It was some minutes before he could rise, his great chest
heaving painfully, and by that time he knew that the
unknown had gone.  He reeled across the hall, bent almost
double, and snapped on the lights in his library.  Every
drawer and cupboard had been hurriedly rifled, and their
contents strewn on the floor, but he gave the damage
scarcely a glance.  From among the wreckage he retrieved a
flashlight and went back to the study, switching on the lights
in the hall on his way.  He went over every inch of the room
in search of anything his late visitor might have lost in the
struggle, and it was quite early in his hunt that he saw
something winking up at him from the carpet.
</p>

<p>
It was a little silver triangle.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
<br><br>
SPECIMENS OF JOURNALESE
</h3>

<p>
Storm trod on the self-starter.  The powerful engine woke
to life with no more than a whispering purr.  Like a long
shadow the Hirondel slid out of the cart track and down
the deserted road between ghostly files of street lamps.
</p>

<p>
He switched on his lights as he turned into the Finchley
Road.
</p>

<p>
It had been a merry evening, and not without those thrilling
moments after which his heart yearned; and it had left
him with things to ponder.  He wanted to know the reason
for Snooper Brome's appearance in the home of Oscar
Raegenssen, and he wanted to know what the hurriedly
lowered blind in an upstairs room had hidden from him,
but it was typical of the man that he accepted Susan's
arrival as though it were the most natural thing in the
world.
</p>

<p>
"Lucky you found me," he remarked.  "Now I can take
you along to the Elysion, and we can consume bacon and
eggs."
</p>

<p>
He made no effort to discover the reason for her
presence, but she enlightened him of her own accord.
</p>

<p>
"It's all Uncle Joe's fault," she explained.  "I'd been to
dinner with him, and—you've had some experience of him—you
know what a bloodthirsty little man he is, and this
Triangle business is meat and strong drink to him.  He was
lecturing me about it for hours after I ought to have gone
home, and he kept dragging Raegenssen into the discussion
and then forgetting what he was going to say about him.
Then he told me Raegenssen lived near by, and promptly
added that women shouldn't get mixed up with crime.  So,
of course, I had to butt in.  Did you kill Snooper?"
</p>

<p>
She asked the question so dispassionately that Storm
laughed.
</p>

<p>
"No," he said mildly.  "Not to-night.  It wasn't—er—expedient.
One of these days I shall probably have to, but
that'll keep.  How much did you see?"
</p>

<p>
"You saw me."
</p>

<p>
"And," said Storm in pained accents, "you saw the police
charging up the garden, and you didn't rally round to assist
the getaway?  Susan, you're going off!"
</p>

<p>
She smiled, and laid a cool hand on his.
</p>

<p>
"Old chap," she said, "that would have been unpardonable.
You knew what you were doing, and you don't need
lessons in looking after yourself.  If I'd thought you wanted
help, I'd have come——"
</p>

<p>
"Like old times," said Storm, and raised her hand to his
lips.
</p>

<p>
He felt curiously exhilarated that night.  It may have
been due to the fresh food for thought which he had
gathered from his adventurous and wholly illegal visit, or
to the sudden bracing rush of swift action he had enjoyed
to the full after overmuch peace and quiet.  Or, on the other
hand, it may have been due to the presence of the girl at his
side....  Storm felt happily incompetent to judge.  He knew,
at least, that the old, gay recklessness had returned to him
in all its reawakened daredevilry.  The cool night air was
grateful on his face: he drew deep breaths of it contentedly,
and it went to his head like wine.  He moved his arms
ecstatically, for the pure sensuous joy of feeling the
rippling suppleness of them.  He laughed softly, irresponsible
and proud, throwing back his head—a splendid animal
glorying in its magnificent manhood.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Susan, this is the life!" he said.  "No dull safety
for me!  I only hope it doesn't end too soon."
</p>

<p>
"You get all the fun," she complained.  "All I can do is to
mooch around waiting to be shot up, and fill in the intervals
lunching with Uncle Joe."
</p>

<p>
"Damn Uncle Joe!" exploded Storm, but this time without
jealousy.  "I'm sick of hearing about Uncle Joe!  Forget
him, kid, and listen to me.  Susan, when this jaunt's over, and
the Alpha Triangle's done the six-foot drop, you're coming
away with me—I don't care where, so long as it's some
place where you can still go gunning for people who annoy
you.  London's all right when there's a Triangle livening
things up, but one day the Triangle'll toe the T in a
whitewashed shed, and I hate stagnation!  We'll start a young
war somewhere, if you like.  Any old thing suits me, so long
as it's disreputable and dangerous....  Is that a bet?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," she said demurely.  "You're so very
unconventional...."  And thereafter he only had one hand for
the steering-wheel.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Storm breakfasted next morning with his usual litter
of newspapers scattered on the floor all around him, but
he was chiefly amused by the alarm of the <i>Daily Record</i>.
To his mind, the crime reports in which the <i>Record</i> specialised
were far more interesting than fiction, for that paper
had a reputation for chewing more meat from tropical bones
than any of its contemporaries.
</p>

<p class="t3">
  WHERE ARE THE POLICE?<br>
  LONDON AT MERCY OF GANG OF MURDERERS.<br>
  GOVERNMENT MUST NOT SURRENDER.<br>
  FURTHER OUTRAGES ANTICIPATED.<br>
  LATEST NEWS OF GIGANTIC CONSPIRACY.<br>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
—and a lot more.  The police, one gathered, were either
incapable or afraid; the Government were meditating
incontinent surrender; England was to be plunged into anarchy;
neither life nor property would be safe....  Only the policy
of the <i>Daily Record</i> was stemming the tide of disaster.
</p>

<p>
"These people aren't helpful," murmured Storm.
"Stampeding sheep!  Bring me some more toast."
</p>

<p>
"Yessir," said Cork.
</p>

<p>
Cork, Storm's valet, was a man with aggrieved eyebrows
and a disapproving mouth.  He had the expression of one
who has looked on the wine when it was sour, and who has
never quite succeeded in getting rid of the taste.  But, at
least, he went about his work with the efficiency of a
superman whose head would be bloody but unbowed despite
plague, pestilence, famine, riot, civil commotion, the fall of
the Conservative Party, the dissolution of the British
Empire, Act of God, or the agitation of the <i>Daily Record</i>.
</p>

<p>
"There is a man downstairs who wishes to speak to you,
sir," he said, returning with reinforcements of coffee.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow was in every line of his pessimistic face, and he
laid a faint emphasis on the word "man."  Storm had never
quite induced his servant to accept Inspector Teal as a
human being.
</p>

<p>
"What's the matter with him, Cork?" asked Storm.
"Leper?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid not, sir," replied Cork gloomily.  "It's the
policeman who calls sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Show him up," said Storm and returned to his newspapers.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal glutinated through the door.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Morn'n," said Storm without looking up.  "Sit down,
Teal.  English or Colonial breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal frowned suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"What's a Colonial breakfast?" he inquired.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a horse's neck, a mutton chop, and a small dog."
</p>

<p>
"What's the small dog for?" queried Mr. Teal
innocently.  "And why a horse's neck?"
</p>

<p>
"The dog eats the mutton chop, and a horse's neck's a
brandy and ginger ale——"
</p>

<p>
"Coffee—thank you, sir," said the shocked Mr. Teal.
"Fat men didn't ought——"
</p>

<p>
Over a steaming cup he surveyed the cheery, comfortable
room.  There were well-filled bookcases, a grand piano,
and an open secretaire strewn with scraps of paper and
writing materials.  On the walls were fencing foils, boxing
gloves, an oar, and over the mantelpiece hung a couple of
sporting rifles.
</p>

<p>
"Nice little place you've got here," he remarked.  "I've
always liked it."
</p>

<p>
"Not so bad!  Listen, Teal.  The papers say, <i>the police
are believed to have a clue</i>.  Why don't we contradict such
wicked slanders?"
</p>

<p>
"It's better than Finchley," pursued Mr. Teal without
emotion.
</p>

<p>
"And this: <i>A sensational arrest is expected at every
moment</i>.  Je-rusalem.  My dear soul, how can even a great man
like yourself make a sensational arrest at every moment?
There aren't enough sensational people in London to maintain
the supply.  Besides, blokes'd start getting peeved."
</p>

<p>
"Raegenssen was peeved," said Mr. Teal sleepily.
</p>

<p>
Storm slewed his chair round so that he faced the
detective, and searched for a cigarette.  His gun-metal grey
eyes were alight with mischief.
</p>

<p>
"Teal!" he protested.  "Why must you be inconsequent?"
</p>

<p>
"Why must you burgle Raegenssen?" asked Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
That quick, flickering smile played about Storm's lips.
</p>

<p>
"How do you know?" he asked calmly.
</p>

<p>
"Your tire tracks were all over that bit of building
ground.  And I called at your garage on my way here and
found dry mud caked all over your wheels.  You don't collect
that sort of mud in the streets."  Mr. Teal blinked twice
and yawned.  He became almost awake, "Mr. Arden, why
can't you and me work together?"
</p>

<p>
"That accusative makes me go all goosey!" complained
Storm.
</p>

<p>
"You and I," Mr. Teal corrected himself.  "Why not?
We'd get on much better."
</p>

<p>
Storm exhaled a thin feather of smoke from the corner
of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"You might," he said.  "But then, you're only a detective."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal accepted the proffered cigar.  His mouth
widened half an inch momentarily.
</p>

<p>
"I shouldn't compromise you," he pleaded.
</p>

<p>
Storm walked over to the window.
</p>

<p>
"How did you come to visit Raegenssen at all?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"I was called early this morning," said Teal.  "I haven't
been to bed yet.  So I heard all about the masked man and the
fancy shooting, and then I remembered you'd promised
to commit a few felonies.  Besides, you can recognise a
Hirondel's tracks—they've got a very wide wheel-base, and
you can only fit Veloris tires."
</p>

<p>
"Bit off your beat, wasn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"No."  The detective rummaged in his pocket and
produced something that was familiar to Storm without a
closer inspection.  "Anything to do with Triangles is on my
beat."
</p>

<p>
Storm took the trinket and stared at it.  Then he paced
quickly up and down the room, his eyes half-closed and his
cigarette tightened up in his lips.  He raised his shoulders
and shoved his hands deep into his pockets, and then he
stopped in his stride abruptly and turned.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get that from Raegenssen?"
</p>

<p>
Teal nodded.
</p>

<p>
"The burglar came back, and the second time he left
that.  He and Raegenssen had a fight, but the Swede stopped
one in the tummy."
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I'm the Triangle?" asked Storm directly.
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal jerked the ash from his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't.  But you know too much about it, and I wish
you'd come across.  There's an inquiry about that Moraine's
stunt scheduled for this afternoon, and the Commissioner
'll be curious."
</p>

<p>
"I want the whole yarn," Storm said after a short pause.
"As heard from Raegenssen."
</p>

<p>
"I can do better," said Teal.  "A reporter who lives out
that way was there even before I was.  It was just ten when
I came along Piccadilly, so I brought you in the midday
edition of the <i>Evening Record</i>."
</p>

<p>
Storm took the sheet and grinned.
</p>

<p>
"You're an old cynic, Teal!" he reproved.
</p>

<p>
He lounged over to the table and rested on the edge of it
while he read with interest the brief account of the
happenings in North London of the small hours of that morning.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"An air of mystery surrounds the two attempts to burgle
the house of Mr. Oscar Raegenssen, the well-known Swedish
merchant, which took place last night.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"How does a house take place, Teal?
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"Mr. Raegenssen had been to a theatre, and had thence
proceeded to a night club—
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"How shocking," murmured Storm.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"—from which he returned to his house in Marchmont
Avenue at about 1 a.m.  He went upstairs immediately and was
undressing when he heard a suspicious sound in his study.  A
moment later a shot rang out.  Stopping only to pull on a
dressing-gown, Mr. Raegenssen hastened downstairs and
found the window wide open and his safe broken open.  Finding
that the telephone wires had been cut, Mr. Raegenssen
returned to his bedroom in order to don some clothes before
summoning the police."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Decency before duty," Storm drawled.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"Two constables who had heard the shot, however, had
already arrived, and had entered the building by way of the
window which the burglar had left open in his flight.
Mr. Raegenssen, meanwhile, had heard a noise in the room adjoining
his bedroom which led him to suspect that the burglar was
perhaps still in the house.  This, indeed, proved to be the case,
and the two officers, assisted by Mr. Raegenssen, attempted to
apprehend the man.  The burglar, however, who was masked
and evidently a dangerous character, drew a pistol and fired
several times at his would-be captors without hitting them,
after which he made a desperate and successful bid for safety.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"About two and a half hours later, when Mr. Raegenssen
who had been too disturbed by the thrilling incident to return
immediately to his bed, was working in his library, he heard a
suspicious sound in his study and attempted to investigate it.
He was promptly attacked with great ferocity by the desperado,
who again contrived to make his escape, but who this
time left behind him a silver triangle of a type which is by now
familiar to readers of the <i>Evening Record</i>.  During the time
it took Mr. Raegenssen to recover sufficiently to rise, the
library was in its turn the subject of the burglar's attentions.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"The extraordinary feature of the affair, however—
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That's three 'howevers.'
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"—is the fact that in neither case—
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That's two cases.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"—was any attempt—
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That's four attempts, Teal.  Beaver! ... Fifteen love.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"—made to abstract anything of value.  The only things
interfered with were the safe and a number of drawers and filing
cabinets in which Mr. Raegenssen kept private papers
concerning his business.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"Inspector Teal, who is working on the Triangle Mystery
in conjunction with Captain Arden, has been called in, and he
is said to have made an important discovery, which is at present
being kept a strict secret."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"How much did you lend this reporter, Teal?" asked
Storm accusingly.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
"It will be remembered that Mr. Raegenssen had already
been the recipient of one of the warnings of the Alpha
Triangle.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Good old Snooper!" said Storm cryptically.  "I knew
he'd get away with it somehow!"  He pitched the paper into
a corner and swung himself off the table.  "And an inquiry.
Well, I'll deal with the inquiry!  But I wish I knew who
Oscar's second friend was."
</p>

<p>
"It wasn't you?" Inspector Teal was incredulous.
</p>

<p>
"It was not.  If you're really interested, I can prove an
alibi; I was inhaling bacon and eggs at the Elysion, or beer
<i>chez</i> Mannering—where Miss Hawthorne's staying—at
the time."
</p>

<p>
Teal wrinkled his brow.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't I hear you mention Snooper?" he prompted, and
Storm nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Snooper was at Raegenssen's last night.  And I let him
go—you can tell that to your Board of Inquiry!  And now,
if you don't mind, we'll leave the subject until this
afternoon."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The Board assembled in the Chief Commissioner's room
at two o'clock, and Storm took his place at one end of the
table without a trace of embarrassment.  Teal, who sat on
his right, was less self-confident, for Inspector Teal was
a conventional detective with a proper awe for the majesty
of Higher Command.  Bill Kennedy, the Assistant Commissioner,
shook hands with Storm as he passed, although his
usual cheeriness was singularly half-hearted.  The Chief,
Sir Brodie Smethurst, was the last to arrive, and with
him came a man whom no one present with the exception of
Storm had expected to see.
</p>

<p>
"What's the Home Secretary doing in this picnic?"
demanded Teal in a hoarse whisper, and Storm shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"I asked him to come," he stated shortly.
</p>

<p>
The preliminary business was soon over, for in theory
the Board had assembled to make an inquiry into Storm's
failure to prevent the robbery at Moraine's; and then
Storm rose to give an account of his progress with the main
problem.
</p>

<p>
"I have no excuses to make for the Moraine's affair," he
said.  "On that score you may take what action you like.
The second point is the double burglary at Raegenssen's
early this morning.  I was the first burglar, but I don't know
who the second was—although I could name the man, with
certainty, in two guesses.  And I'll make you a prophecy:
within the next forty-eight hours the man known as
Raegenssen will either have disappeared or been killed! ... I
have no excuses for the burglary either.  It merely
happened to be necessary.  By swearing information I might
conceivably have got a search warrant, but I decided that
that course would be both risky and futile, because the
issue of the warrant would alarm the man I was anxious to
trap; futile, because it might have been necessary to repeat
the search without the man being aware that an official
search had been made.  I was both lucky and unlucky.  I found
what I expected, to a certain extent, but the arrival of the
police gave me no time to find out all that I wanted to.  To
this moment Raegenssen does not know that his visitor was
not a common thief, and therefore he will be killed.  If I had
revealed my identity to the police, he would have recognised
me, and <i>I</i> should have been killed.  It was, you see, a matter
of my life or—his."
</p>

<p>
They listened without comprehending.
</p>

<p>
"You suspect Raegenssen of having some connection
with the Alpha Triangle?" suggested Smethurst.
</p>

<p>
"I <i>know</i>," said Storm carefully, "that the evidence I have
secured from Raegenssen, together with what I have
obtained from another man, will kill the Alpha Triangle.  I
could arrest the Apex to-day—but I won't!"
</p>

<p>
He heard the suppressed gasp that went up, and smiled
faintly at Inspector Teal's muffled "Good God!"
</p>

<p>
"No one but myself," he went on simply, "has anything
like the evidence necessary to secure a conviction—I even
doubt very much if I could get one myself.  You can be satisfied
that it is a moral certainty, even if it would fail to
convince a Grand Jury.  But, at the instance of the late Lord
Hannassay, and with the consent of Sir John Marker, I was
given carte blanche in this case, and you must continue that
support."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Must</i> is a strong word, Captain Arden," said the Home
Secretary mildly.
</p>

<p>
"I am a strong man," said Storm.
</p>

<p>
He spoke quietly, not as a boaster, but as one who states
a fact, and his cool assurance staggered the Board.
Whereas before they had been scowling or incredulous,
according to temperament, they were united in indignation.
</p>

<p>
"P-please make yourself p-p-plain," stammered Smethurst
harshly.
</p>

<p>
"It's rather obvious already," said Storm calmly.  "The
Alpha Triangle is my father.  You needn't think I'm giving
away my secret, because I'm not!  If you took the trouble to
trace my father, you'd come up against a dead end.  You'd
laugh at the idea—just as you'd laugh if I told you openly
now.  But, anyway, I don't want you to try and trace him.
I don't want this case messed up with a lot of flat-footed
half-wits trying to take my place!  You're at my mercy.  Do
what you like.  Sack me.  Keep me on under supervision.  It
won't help you, because in a few hours I shall be the only
man who can hope to catch the Alpha Triangle.  In time, I
mean.  Of course, I suppose there are plenty of other men
who could mug along till they got him—but by that time the
Triangle will have cost the country hundreds of thousands
of pounds and many lives.  You can take your choice...."
</p>

<p>
He had them stymied.  Their world was reeling about
their ears.  Never within living memory had a man dared
to address a Board of Inquiry in such an arrogant manner.
Storm set at naught their authority, he was coldly indifferent
to the fact that he laid himself open to prosecution, he
had given them an ultimatum with all the casualness of a
man to whom acceptance or rejection means nothing to
speak of—and the chilled insolence of it dazed them.  And
Storm, while they strove to collect their wits, was leisurely
lighting a cigarette and smiling as affably as if he had
merely made some commonplace remark about the weather,
instead of handing out to Their Augustnesses the starkest
slice of sheer frozen case-hardened nerve in their experience....
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere was electric.  It seemed to have temporarily
hypnotised all but two of them—Bill Kennedy—who
was leaning back in his chair with a grin of pure delight
on his ugly face, and Sir John Marker, who was tapping his
teeth reflectively with a pencil and apparently considering
Storm's proposition as seriously as he would have
considered a question in the House.
</p>

<p>
"It is an extraordinary situation, Captain Arden," he
admitted.  "I can see your point—up to a point.  But if, as
you say, your father is involved, hadn't you better pass the
case over to someone else?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Storm steadily.
</p>

<p>
"Can't you be a little more explicit, then?"
</p>

<p>
"I can tell you this: I first suspected my man on a day
when I had a slight accident."  Storm spoke slowly and
evenly, ignoring the stunned faces of the Board and
addressing his remarks to the Home Secretary.  He was standing
erect, with the tips of his fingers resting on the table in
front of him, completely at ease.  "I was driving down
Cockspur Street, and my car skidded and knocked Raegenssen
down.  There were present Mr. Blaythwayt, manager of the
Lombard Street City and Continental; Mattock, a convict
on licence employed by Raegenssen; and Miss Hawthorne,
Lord Hannassay's secretary.  Of those people, two were in
a position to note the same thing as I did—the first piece
of evidence against my father."  He smiled again at their
perplexity.  "Acting on this, I burgled Raegenssen last night,
and learnt something of the next coup planned by the
Triangle.  I also acquired a fresh suspicion, which I hope to
verify soon.  But that's all speculation.  The solid fact," he
said, watching them with a glimmer of amusement in his
eyes, "is that one is always interested in a saw-mill which
has recently received a consignment of machinery and
materials that have nothing whatever to do with the sawing of
wood!"
</p>

<p>
"Do we have to play at Sexton Blake when there aren't
any reporters with us?" drawled Bill Kennedy.
</p>

<p>
Storm grinned.
</p>

<p>
"I must have notice of that question," he murmured, and
sat down.
</p>

<p>
Then the bottled-up feelings of the Police Chiefs had
their vent, and a hum of argument broke out like the snarl
of numerous irritated bees.  Marker remained aloof, taking
no part in the discussion, but listening shrewdly to what
his neighbours had to say.  Bill Kennedy waved a hand to
Storm and lighted a cigar, seemingly bored with the whole
business.
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal was shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
"Never," he muttered breathlessly, "never, never did I
hope to see this day....  Kent Road's nothin'—he's knocked
'em on the old Embankment and he's got away with it...."  His
vast form vibrated with Titanic ecstasy....  "'Flat-footed
half-wits ... you can take your choice!' ... Oh,
Boy!... <i>Oh</i>, BOY!..."
</p>

<p>
"Teal!" whispered Storm reprovingly.  "This mirth is
nearly indecent!"
</p>

<p>
He himself was sublimely unconcerned, for he knew exactly
where he had the Great Ones of Scotland Yard.  He
had them right where he wanted them, gently but firmly
held down under his brogues, and he wasn't of the type to
indulge in gloating on that account.  It had simply been, in
his opinion, necessary for him to stand on their necks, and
he had done it.  That was all.  It never occurred to him to
crow about it, any more than he gave a snide halfpenny for
the consequences.
</p>

<p>
He finished his cigarette and extinguished it, and selected
a second.  The drone of dispute died away.
</p>

<p>
"Will you answer some questions?" asked Sir John Marker.
</p>

<p>
"Within limits—yes," Storm gave back without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"Are you convinced that you know the Triangle?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes,"
</p>

<p>
"You based your conclusion entirely on two scraps of
evidence?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Solely?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  Only a born fool forms a theory on the basis of
two scraps of evidence without applying the known facts
to that theory and finding out how it wears."
</p>

<p>
"And you think your theory stands the test?"
</p>

<p>
"Beautifully."
</p>

<p>
"What chance would you give your theory in a court of
law?"
</p>

<p>
"About as much chance as a very small icicle in a burning
fiery furnace," said Storm carefully—"depending, of
course, on the precise grade of imbeciles you chose your
jury from."
</p>

<p>
The Home Secretary conferred in an undertone with
Smethurst.
</p>

<p>
"Then you think," he said, his lips twitching at the
corners, "that if you are allowed to go on in your own way.
without question, you will be able to raise your theory to the
standard of obviousness demanded by a jury of average
imbeciles?"
</p>

<p>
"It's possible."
</p>

<p>
"And what about the crimes which may be committed
by the Triangle while you are attempting to do this?"
</p>

<p>
"They will be fewer than if you took the case out of my
hands."
</p>

<p>
"Then what are your immediate plans?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to confirm my theory to my own satisfaction,
and—by way of an impartial witness—to the satisfaction
of Inspector Teal; and then I shall find the Triangle,
and——"
</p>

<p>
"And?"
</p>

<p>
"He will die," said Storm simply.  "But it will not be on
the gallows."
</p>

<p>
His even, unemotional tone held them all rapt.  In spite
of themselves, his personality had gripped them.  His slim
straight figure stood out above them; his level confident
voice commanded their unwilling attention; he dominated
the scene as surely as if he had sat in the Chief
Commissioner's chair with all the authority of Parliament behind
him.
</p>

<p>
"That," he said, "is the only reason why I do not intend
to conduct this case in the normal way."  He looked around
him searchingly, and then his eyes returned to the Home
Secretary.  "I will now make my demands."  They gasped
again at that—his unassuming presumption was a paradox
they needed time to digest.  "You will permit me to go on
with the case as I wish, with the assistance of Inspector
Teal.  You will ask for no information, nor will you follow
up the hints I have given you this afternoon.  You will keep
secret my real name, which is now known to you, until I
wish the fact to be published.  You will allow me to take
what counter-measures I think fit to meet the offensive of
the Triangle.  That may seem arrogant," he continued after
a short silence, as though the possibility had just occurred
to him.  "As a matter of fact, it's only to emphasise my
determination.  Anyway, you wouldn't all mess about with the
case, so my reticence won't hinder you.  Mr. Kennedy and
Inspector Teal will vouch for my competence.  In a fortnight
the Triangle will have ceased to be—I can guarantee
that..."
</p>

<p>
He paused, while Bill Kennedy and the for-once-completely-awake
Mr. Teal nodded their answers to the unspoken
question of the rest of the Board.
</p>

<p>
"Finally," said Storm, "if Sir John Marker would like
to come into a private room with me, I will tell him the name
of the Apex of the Triangle."
</p>

<p>
The Home Secretary deliberated for a moment, and then
led the way.  They were absent for fully half an hour,
during which time Bill Kennedy appeared to go to sleep and
Inspector Teal stolidly shook his head and refused to
answer the questions that were showered upon him.
</p>

<p>
When Sir John Marker returned his face was white and
he seemed to be shivering.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Arden continues with the case, on his own
terms," he instructed curtly.  "I may say that I agree with
his attitude in every way.  But keep it dark ... I don't want
trouble in the House."
</p>

<p>
The other members of the Board stared at him blankly,
for they had anticipated nothing so decisive.  There was an
eerie chill in the air, born of Sir John Marker's ghostly
pallor, that would have shaken less matter-of-fact men.
The hint of something vast and menacing and incomprehensible
loomed over them ... something bigger than even
the <i>Daily Record</i> had ever dreamed of....
</p>

<p>
They broke up into little groups which converged on the
placid Storm and the now weary Teal, while Sir Brodie
Smethurst escorted the Home Secretary from the room.
</p>

<p>
As the Minister was taking his leave, the Chief
Commissioner stopped him.
</p>

<p>
"There's been a lot of talk about that man Raegenssen,"
he said.  "I've heard other things about him which make him
interesting in a general way, apart from the Triangle.  Can't
I have that one question?"
</p>

<p>
The Home Secretary moistened his dry lips as he shook
his head, and smiled crookedly.
</p>

<p>
"Oscar Raegenssen must have been reincarnated," he
said flatly.  "He's been dead two days..."
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
<br><br>
RETURN OF AN EXILE
</h3>

<p>
There was a thin yellow envelope which was familiar to
the members of the Alpha Triangle, for it was in such
envelopes that they received their weekly general orders,
and in similar envelopes the lieutenants of the Apex
communicated with their Chief, under one or another of his
various aliases.  It was one of these which caught the eye
of Joan Sands on a certain morning when she entered the
living-room for her belated breakfast.  It lay beside her
husband's plate unopened, for James Mattock was absorbed
in the latest news about the Alpha Triangle, as purveyed by
the <i>Daily Mercury</i>, and seemed to be unattached for the
moment by the more intimate news which awaited his
scrutiny.
</p>

<p>
He glanced up as she came in, gave her a perfunctory
smile, and went on with his reading.
</p>

<p>
Joan took her seat and poured herself out some coffee.
There were unbecoming shadows under her eyes; and, not
yet rouged and powdered, she was unhealthily pale.  The girl
had altered during the past week, and Mattock had noticed
the change without understanding it.  There had never been
any love between them—the old sophisticated Joan would
have scoffed at the idea—but there had been Mattock's
infatuation and the girl's readiness to accept anything that
offered in the shape of easy money and a good time.  He had
done much for her—had served a term of imprisonment to
save her life—and she was grateful.  But love ... no.  She
was a gold-digger, and she was honest about it; she played
the game by him, because her own peculiar code commanded
her to.  She would have given him what he wanted without
the formality of marriage, because she was fond of him in
a cynical way, and he had been very good to her in his
unworldly, altruistic manner.  Not that she was in any sense
promiscuous; that was about the only form of gold-digging
she barred, and that fact, perhaps, constituted her only
virtue in the eyes of her victims.
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to analyse her mind.  A child of the people,
she had risen to the fringe of Society by reason of her
beauty, wit, vivacity, and a certain acquired refinement,
while her less gifted brother remained in the ranks of the
petty in-and-out-of-"stir" sneak-thieves.  She kept up her
position because she was unscrupulous where money was
concerned.  And yet, incredible as it may seem, for all the
wealth her foolish middle-aged admirers had offered her,
she had come to James Mattock a virgin.  So ill-assorted a
couple were they—James Mattock, Oxford graduate and
gentleman by birth, who had in his headlong course down-hill
tasted all but the ultimate dregs of dissipation, unselfishly
in love with a woman of the criminal classes whose
chastity had been her only claim to his consideration....
</p>

<p>
He was at a loss, now, to interpret her changed attitude
towards him.  Ordinarily, she had been the ideal of a good
comrade to him—not demonstratively affectionate, yet
kindly sympathetic, loyal and trustworthy.  Of late she had
become rather distant.  There was an awkwardness between
them which exasperated Mattock and perplexed the girl
herself.
</p>

<p>
"You've forgotten your letter," she reminded him as he
drained his cup and rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes."
</p>

<p>
He was preoccupied.  She could see the lines of worry
on his face.  He had been past middle age when he had met
her, and prison had aged him; he had aged even more during
the last few days.  His unspoken trouble awakened the
old companionship—shook for a moment the strange barrier
of reserve which had separated them so incomprehensibly.
</p>

<p>
She fetched his hat and umbrella for him, and then put
her hands on his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Jimmy?" she prompted.  "You're so quiet
lately."
</p>

<p>
"Am I?  Oh, yes, dear, perhaps I am a bit.  I'm not feeling
quite myself."  His voice was expressionless.  "This—the
whole thing's rather getting on my nerves, I think."
</p>

<p>
He had forgotten the yellow envelope in spite of her
reminder, and she went back for it and placed it in his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Do you have to go on?" she said wistfully.  "I wish—I
wish you'd drop it, Jimmy."
</p>

<p>
"You wouldn't have this flat, then," he said innocently.
</p>

<p>
"D'you think that's everything in my life?" she broke
out resentfully.  "Didn't I marry you when you hadn't a
bean—when you had to—to steal for me?  Have we always
got to have this life, with everyone's hand against us, and
nothing in the future ... <i>nothing</i> ...  unless it's Aylesbury
for me and the Awful Place for you?"  The wall was down
now.  "This silly feud of yours is going to cost us
everything!  That's the only idea you've got in your head—to
satisfy your rotten vanity, and get your paltry revenge—and
you'll go on slogging at it, and risking on it, and wasting
your whole life on it!  You've set it up as your god, and
you'll sacrifice everything to it—sacrifice yourself—sacrifice
<i>me</i>! ... You've kidded yourself that heaven's at the
end of this road you're going, and you'll sweat for your
worm-eaten heaven—you'll slave and slink and cringe and
break your heart to feed this bloody thing that's gnawing
away inside you—and what good'll it do you?"
</p>

<p>
"We've had all this before," said Mattock tonelessly.
"I've got to go on.  I'm sorry, Joan....  But you can get out
of it—it nearly broke me up when I found you were in the
Triangle, but it's been on my mind ever since.  Get out of it,
Joan, and don't fret.  We'll pull through somehow."
</p>

<p>
She faced him accusingly, unshed tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"If it costs you everything—in spite of all I've said,
you're going on?" she flared.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Even if you lose ... <i>me</i>?"
</p>

<p>
He stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"You, Joan?  Why, how does it touch you?  You can go—I've
told you I'd prefer you to—and then, when it's all
over——"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>when</i>!" she blazed back.  "And when that happens
you'll be dead—dead!  Don't you know that?  You're playing
skittles with dynamite, James Mattock—you're screwing
your head into the mouth of a howitzer with a wild
horse harnessed to the lanyard!  You're mad!"  She clung to
him convulsively, her head buried in his shabby coat.
"Jimmy, give it up ... don't go on asking for death!"
</p>

<p>
Instinctive actress though she was, her passionate
outburst was desperately sincere, and Mattock passed a shaking
hand across his forehead as if to brush away a veil that
clouded his eyes.  And yet, when he took her gently by the
shoulders and set her from him, the dull blankness of his
eyes had given place only to the glimmer of a fanatical
light.
</p>

<p>
"There was Sylvia," he said.  "I must go on....  She
suffered cruelly ... I must...."
</p>

<p>
He spoke as one who repeats a prayer, and as she drew
away from him it seemed as if the old insurmountable wall
slid into the space between them.  She must have realised it,
for she made a last fierce effort to break through his armour.
</p>

<p>
"Are you blind?" she whispered tremblingly.  "The
strain's getting too much for me—and it's not myself I'm
worrying about....  I've been blind too, and I've just
realised it....  Jim"—a wonderful light was born suddenly
in her eyes—"oh, Jimmy"—breathlessly—"Jimmy——"
</p>

<p>
And then, in the old caprice of Fate, the clock struck.
The sharp chime of it perked Mattock from his throbbing
expectancy, wiped the dawning comprehension from his
face, lashed and wrenched and hammered and tortured him
back behind the reef that had all but crumbled away—beat
him back to the cold matter-of-fact reality of things and
his madness....  Flung back into his brain the madness that
had come to him one drizzling afternoon when he had
sworn to set a Goal above all Prizes....  Gave him back the
Ambition—the One Idea....
</p>

<p>
"I must be going," he said unevenly, for the hurt showed
in his voice.  "Can't afford to lose my job.  Cheer up, Joan."
</p>

<p>
He kissed her—not perfunctorily now, but with all the
frustrated longing of his heart.  And then he strode swiftly
from the place.
</p>

<p>
He saw little of Raegenssen that morning, for the Swede
marched straight through the outer office without his
customary "Goot morning!" to his clerk, and gave no
instructions for the day's work.
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen locked himself in the inner office and lighted
a cigar.  He opened the big safe and took down from it a
number of ledgers and a bundle of miscellaneous papers
bound up with tape.  Each one of the books and papers he
went through carefully three times, as though memorising
their contents, and then he tore out the pages which bore his
scrawling handwriting, added the other papers to the pile,
and carried the whole over to the fireplace.  He watched
them burn until every least scrap was reduced to brittle
black flakes, and then with the poker he stirred and
powdered the ash to a fine dust.  Even this, to make doubly
sure, he swept up into the shovel and threw from the window.
</p>

<p>
He was left with three photographs, and these he placed
in the wallet he carried in an inside pocket.
</p>

<p>
Then he resumed his seat and sat through the time it
took him to smoke another cigar, motionless except for the
regular monotonous twisting of the pencil in his strong
hands.  It was nearing eleven-thirty when with a sudden
movement of decision he snapped the pencil in half, pitched
it into the waste-paper basket and rose.  He picked up his
battered hat, unlocked the door, and passed again through
the outer office without a word or a glance to either side,
and Mattock watched his departure with a puzzled frown.
</p>

<p>
He went to the City and Continental, drew some money,
and made certain arrangements.
</p>

<p>
"I see you've had a burglar," remarked Blaythwayt when
they had concluded their business.
</p>

<p>
"Yess.  He debarted away!"  The Swede's voice was lifeless.
</p>

<p>
"So the police haven't caught him yet?"
</p>

<p>
Raegenssen glowered.
</p>

<p>
"No!" he snapped.  "Der bolice are fools!  Why hof they
nod ter Driangle abbrehented?"
</p>

<p>
He usually stayed for a short chat with his bank manager,
but this morning he seemed curiously disinclined to
be conversational.  Joe Blaythwayt himself opened the door
to his customer, and that simple soul was almost personally
apologetic, for Raegenssen's comments on the Force seemed
a direct slight on the lethargic officer who was wont on
occasion to brighten the Finchley Nights Entertainments.
</p>

<p>
That same Teal, driving down Lombard Street in a taxi
with a couple of unsuccessful jargoon sellers, saw the
Swede leaving the bank and chuckled.
</p>

<p>
"You boys want to aim high," he said.  "Fifteen million
pounds for a few murders is better than a hundred for a
white sapphire!"
</p>

<p>
Things happened to Mr. Teal in those days with the well-oiled
precision of a detective story from a master pen.  He
was chatting downstairs in Scotland Yard that afternoon
when a vast young man of incredible ugliness came hurtling
down the steps three at a time.
</p>

<p>
"I want you, Teal," he crisped.  "Where's Captain Arden?"
</p>

<p>
Teal came to attention.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, sir.  He hasn't been in all day.  He said he'd
be here about dinner-time."
</p>

<p>
"Get him on the phone."
</p>

<p>
Teal called the number, and was answered by the voice
of Cork.  He snapped out a curt demand, listened, and then
snicked back the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"No good, sir," he said.  "Captain Arden's been out since
eleven this morning and his man doesn't know where he is."
</p>

<p>
"Hell!" snarled the Assistant Commissioner.  "You'd better
come along, then."
</p>

<p>
Bill Kennedy led the way to the waiting taxi, Teal
following obediently, and it was not until they were turning
out into the Embankment that the Commissioner explained.
</p>

<p>
"The Triangle's on the war-path again," he said.  "Marker
was shot this afternoon as he was leaving his house."
</p>

<p>
"Dead?" drawled the callous Teal, and Kennedy shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"The message didn't say.  Did Captain Arden give you
any idea what he was doing this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"He said he was going to commit another felony to-day.
I wonder if he is the Triangle?" suggested Mr. Teal
lusciously.
</p>

<p>
His inspiration being received with scorn, he maintained
a dignified silence until the taxi drew up in Queen's Gate,
where the Home Secretary lived.  The usual crowd was gaping
about the entrance, only restrained from closer
investigation by the presence of two burly constables.  The two
detectives pushed their way through the mob and were
instantly admitted.
</p>

<p>
The doctor who had been summoned was already preparing
for an impromptu operation, and was inclined to be
brusque.
</p>

<p>
"The bullet glanced off a rib and tore up his right lung,"
he said shortly.  "I may be able to save his life, but it's very
chancy."
</p>

<p>
The most coherent narrative was supplied by the
chauffeur, who had been actually holding the door for his
master at the time of the shooting.
</p>

<p>
"There were three cars close together—a Navarre
limousine, a Carillon cabriolet, and a Hirondel sports.  I
couldn't be sure which it was, as I had my back to the street
and didn't turn until I heard the report.  I should say it
was either the Navarre or the Hirondel—they were nearest
when I looked round."
</p>

<p>
"Did you get any numbers?" asked Kennedy.
</p>

<p>
"No.  They all put on speed immediately the shot was
fired, and I was too busy attending to my master to look at
them closely.  Oh—I remember the Hirondel was very
battered—looked as if it had been in an air-raid.
ZY-something.  There was a '2' in it, anyway."
</p>

<p>
"ZY 28822?" murmured Teal, and the man nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Something like that.  It was the last car of the three,
and they all raced into Cromwell Road, so that's the only
number I got a glimpse of."
</p>

<p>
Kennedy dismissed the man and glanced at Teal.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Arden on duty," he said.  "That looks like a thin
time for Morini.  It was the gentle Gat, of course."
</p>

<p>
"How're you going to prove it?" Teal wanted to know.
</p>

<p>
"Your business!"  Bill Kennedy took his cigar-case from
his pocket and offered it.  "This isn't my case at all, really,
only Marker's so deuced important."
</p>

<p>
"What about Hannassay?"
</p>

<p>
The Assistant Commissioner carefully charred the end
of his cigar and then placed it in his mouth and lighted it
meticulously.
</p>

<p>
"Hannassay's was his own fault," he said.  "The man refused
protection—-said he could look after himself, and that
he wouldn't have his holiday messed up with a lot of
detectives hanging round.  He had a compartment to himself—I
saw him off—and it was a corridor train.  He must have
been easy."
</p>

<p>
They waited to hear the result of the doctor's operation,
for there was clearly nothing they could do for the moment.
An all-station call for Morini had been out for days without
result, and unless their luck changed the only hope was
that Storm would be able to hold up the gunman.
</p>

<p>
A butler came in with a tray of sandwiches and offered
them the use of the syphon and decanter in the corner.  They
talked on odd subjects, and it was just before they received
their report that Bill Kennedy opened up a new line of
thought to Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
"What we really need in a case like this is the German
Razzia," he remarked.  "If a wanted man's patient and
really ingenious, he's as hard to find as water in the desert.
All he has to do is to retire to the house of a friend, or
to a fairly big residential hotel, and never budge out of
doors.  By simply lying doggo instead of trying to make a
bolt for it, he could have the police rubbering till all's blue,
and never be in danger."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the doctor arrived.
</p>

<p>
There was a hope—yes.  Marker was a healthy man in
good condition, and stood as much chance of pulling round
as anyone.  It had been a nasty wound, and the illness would
be a ticklish business, but it would not necessarily be fatal.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's a relief," Kennedy said as they returned to
the street.  "But it don't let us out, laddie.  Morini must have
been rattled—according to Captain Arden, that dago's one
of the slickest gunmen in the world."
</p>

<p>
Towards eight o'clock that evening, when Storm had
failed to put in his promised appearance, Inspector Teal
huddled into his mackintosh and set out to walk down the
Embankment towards the restaurant in New Bridge Street
where he occasionally fed.  He was a man who never
complained of the vilest weather, seeming even to revel in it;
which was fortunate for him, for the rain was pouring
down in stinging clouds, drumming on the macadam like a
stage effect.  The sky was black and thunderous, and from
time to time a crackling reverberation omened the continuation
of the downpour.  Such few pedestrians as there were
scurried along under umbrellas with stifled curses and a
drowned-rat-like aspect, but Teal plodded along with his
shoulders squared and his face defiantly thrust out to meet
the lash of the storm.
</p>

<p>
He was within sight of Blackfriars Bridge when he first
noticed the tail lamp of a stationary car, and wondered that
anyone provided with such a luxury should dally by the way
on such a night.  As he came abreast he saw that the driver
was poring over a map, and as Teal passed he was hailed.
</p>

<p>
"Can you tell me the way——" began the man, and
then the flickering light of a street lamp swaying in the
wind fell across his face, and Teal let out an exclamation.
</p>

<p>
"You're Carl Schwesen," he said, "and you were deported
six months ago for——"
</p>

<p>
So far he got before the driver's fist shot out and ripped
into his face.  Half-stunned with pain, the detective
staggered back, tripped on the kerb, and fell.  As he did so the
car jumped forward.
</p>

<p>
He was fumbling for his whistle when he saw it had
slowed up again, and he struggled to regain his feet.  And
then a heavy-calibre revolver thundered from the interior,
and his hat went flying.
</p>

<p>
He got out his whistle and blew a piercing blast, but the
driver of the car accelerated and dashed up the empty road
into the obscurity of the streaming rain.  He saw the car
speed over the bridge, and knew that he had no hope of
catching it, but the number was firmly imprinted on his
memory.
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal continued towards his dinner with a furrowed
brow, for he well knew the brilliance and unscrupulousness
of the erstwhile deported Austrian chemist.  Without
being able to give any logical reason for his suspicion,
he had more than an idea that Schwesen's return was not
unconnected with the sudden inrush of other dangerous
men into London, and he wondered what this fresh activity
of the Triangle might mean.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI
<br><br>
EZRA SURCON DIGS
</h3>

<p>
There was a man named Ezra Surcon who owned much
land in London.  He did not court publicity; there were no
paragraphs about him in the gossip columns of the
newspapers, and as a matter of fact his name was never
mentioned, even in whispers, among the Real Estate Kings of
the metropolis.  He made his purchases quickly and without
ostentation, and the fact remains that in the space of
three days he acquired the freehold of no less than seven
properties.  There was a gloomy house in Buckingham Gate,
and another, equally gloomy, in College Street.  For a large
sum he secured a vacant building in Great Windmill Street;
the imposing mansion in Queen's Gate cost him less; and a
modest erection in Orange Street was comparatively cheap.
He paid reasonable prices for No. 94, Carter Lane and
No. 53, Montague Street.  In all, he must have expended five
considerable figures of hard cash, but since he transacted
his business under seven different aliases no one was startled
by the magnitude of his investments.
</p>

<p>
He was a tall loose-limbed man of rising sixty, yet the
elasticity of his gait as he walked down Constitution Hill
that evening showed that the years had made only superficial
inroads on his physique.  The benevolence of his
expression was emphasised by the large horn-rimmed spectacles
he wore, and contradicted by the tightness of his
mouth and the angularity of his jaw.  A studious stoop took
some inches off his height and the shabbiness of his clothes
gave no indication of the wealth to which his lavish
expenditures in other directions testified.
</p>

<p>
He passed behind the Victoria Memorial and entered
Buckingham Gate.  The residence of which he was the proud
landlord stood only a short distance down the road—a gaunt
and grimy affair having about it that indescribable air of
forbidding unkemptness which is a seal upon the seats of
the mighty.  The blinds in all the downstairs windows were
drawn, and there was no sign of life about the place.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he stood at the foot of the steps, and if
the suggestion had not been so palpably incongruous one
would have said he was listening intently for a sound he
half expected to come from beneath his feet.  Then he
inserted his latchkey in the lock and passed inside.
</p>

<p>
The panelled hall was in twilight, and his footsteps rang
out hollowly on the uncarpeted parquet.  The soles of his
shoes gritted on strewn earth, and sporadic cakes of dirt
disfigured the rest of the floor.  Peering into one room, he
found it filled almost to the ceiling with a great mound of
soil and clay.
</p>

<p>
A door at the back opened suddenly, and he was confronted
by a burly man, stripped to the waist.
</p>

<p>
"Getting on, Torino?" queried Mr. Surcon shortly, and
the giant nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Very well, <i>signor</i>."
</p>

<p>
From head to foot the man was stippled and plastered
with mud, and the streaming perspiration had cut eccentric
patterns in the mess.
</p>

<p>
He led the way through the kitchen and opened a second
door.  Before them yawned a flight of stairs which led down
into the earth, shrouded in a half-light in which danced the
beam of the Italian's flashlight as he guided his employer
towards the cellars.  The steps themselves were inches deep
in trodden clay, and down one side ran two heavy insulated
cables.  From below them came a muffled thud and clatter.
</p>

<p>
Presently they met another man, half-naked like the
guide, who bore on his shoulders a huge basket of earth,
and almost on his heels came a second.  Surcon passed them
with a brief word of greeting.
</p>

<p>
They reached the cellars and made their way with difficulty
across the layer of soil which cloyed their feet.  At the
far end of the vault yawned a circular hole, and it was from
this that the sounds they heard came.
</p>

<p>
"We have done eighty yards," said Torino.  "Another
twenty will be sufficient.  That engine is a marvel.  To-night
we finish."
</p>

<p>
"There's been no difficulty?"
</p>

<p>
"None, <i>signor</i>.  We have many men, and they are relieved
before they tire.  There are no complaints, for the pay is
good."
</p>

<p>
They stumbled down the tunnel towards the bobbing light
that showed in the distance.  The roof was low, and they had
to bow their heads; even so, Surcon cracked his head once
on a buttress and swore softly.  A third man, similarly laden
with a muddy basket, passed them, and they caught the
heavy tread of the two they had passed on the stairs returning.
</p>

<p>
At length they reached the end.
</p>

<p>
A powerful electric bulb swung from a stake driven into
the earthen roof, making the tunnel almost as light as day.
Right up against the ultimate wall was a thing of shining
metal on a wheeled truck.  The power cables connected with
two large terminals on its outer casing, and over it hovered
a wizened man with a rag and an oilcan.  It thrummed and
thudded with the quiet-efficiency of its compressed strength,
and from its stern a stream of earth poured down an iron
channel into the waiting baskets.  Other men, stripped to the
waist and sweating, snatched away the baskets as they were
filled and rushed them away.  From time to time the engineer
slewed the truck round so that the machine attacked a fresh
area, and once he adjusted a winch that raised it bodily on
the truck to burrow at the height of the passage.
</p>

<p>
Surcon tapped him on the shoulder, and he turned drawing
a greasy hand across his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"It gives no trouble?" he asked in German, and the man
shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nein, Herr.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"The dynamo runs well?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Recht wohl, Herr.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sehr gut!</i>"
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by Torino, he retraced his steps laboriously,
for the tunnel had a distinct upward gradient from the
point where the engine was working.  He was glad to return
to the comparative freshness of the hall, for the
atmosphere below was close and almost insufferable.
</p>

<p>
They entered a room at the back of the house which had
once been a beautiful dining-room.  Now the polished
mahogany table was scarred and stained, and the remains of
a meal were congealing on the chipped plates.  A pack of
cards was spread on the seat of one chair, and a dozen empty
beer bottles stood by the wall.
</p>

<p>
With a gesture of distaste Surcon swept the debris from
one end of the table, dusted a chair with his handkerchief,
and sat down delicately.  His companion followed suit
without these precautions.
</p>

<p>
"Where are the others?" asked Ezra.
</p>

<p>
"They sleep upstairs, <i>signor</i>.  In an hour they relieve
those who are working now."
</p>

<p>
"There is enough room for the earth?"
</p>

<p>
"Barely, <i>signor</i>.  Much will have to be spread on the floor
of the tunnel and in the cellars.  A little will go in the
upstairs room where the relief are resting."
</p>

<p>
They spoke in Italian, for Mr. Surcon was a linguist.
</p>

<p>
He took out a bulging wallet and counted out a large
sum, and passed the notes across the table.
</p>

<p>
"There is the pay," he said, "and there is a hundred per
cent. bonus for finishing so soon.  You will go from here
to the other foremen, and tell them to promise their men the
same if they complete their work at the time I have ordered."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Grazie, signor—subito.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"When they finish, they will return to headquarters.
Only two need remain—yourself and one other.  It is
understood?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Perfettamento.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The reason of his visit disposed of, the whim seized him
to make a second tour of inspection below.  This time he did
not penetrate the tunnel, but sat on an up-ended packing-case
in the cellar, gazing down towards the winking luminance
that showed where his machine ploughed on tirelessly.
The clamour and purr of it hypnotised him.  He realised
then, as for the first time, the colossal daring of his plot, and
its immense simplicity.  The shaft which faced him was
paralleled by six others, in various stages of progress, that were
being driven to his command at that moment, by similar
machinery.  He had a stabbing comprehension of the
immensity of the Power he was moulding to his hand....
</p>

<p>
The man Torino, breaking out of the gloom with one of
the waste-baskets on his back, paused at the look of
intentness on his master's face.
</p>

<p>
"It is the plan of a genius," he said softly.  "So simple—and
so unbeatable!  It will mean wealth for all."
</p>

<p>
Surcon nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Wealth....  But this little hole will be used last.  It is
our safety-valve—our trump card.  While this remains
unused and a secret, there can be no danger."
</p>

<p>
He followed his foreman back to the sty of a living-room
and sat down with his chin in his palms, staring into
vacancy.  The Italian lighted a rank cigarette and searched
among the bottles for an unopened one, which he failed to
find.  Neither spoke, for each was busy with his own
thoughts, and the rap-clang of the brass knocker on the
front door made them both start.
</p>

<p>
"See who it is," ordered Surcon, and Torino nodded and
tip-toed from the room.
</p>

<p>
He was back in a moment with a small innocent-looking
man whose china-blue eyes swept round the dining-room in
one wary all-embracing glance.
</p>

<p>
"Morini!" snapped Surcon.  "Why the devil have you
come here?  Fool!  Would you lead the police——"
</p>

<p>
"The bulls aren't after me," said Morini calmly.  "Arden
was on the spot as usual—damn him!—but your idea of
having two cars was a brain-wave.  He smashed his car into
the Carillon, just as I expected, and I jumped from the
Navarre.  Gee!—I've never seen a man look so sick!  He
started gunning from the wreckage—plumb in the middle
of West Cromwell Road—but we were round the next
corner too quick for him."
</p>

<p>
He spoke without Mecklen's nasal twang, for "Gat"
Morini had once been a gentleman—notwithstanding which
fact he was infinitely the more dangerous of the two.
</p>

<p>
"Did you get Marker?"
</p>

<p>
"Not fatally, though he may die.  I always know to a
fraction of an inch where my shots go.  Arden was so much
on the premises he worried me a little, and I misjudged the
speed of the car."
</p>

<p>
Surcon shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"It doesn't matter," he remarked.  "Gunning is crude—I
have a better plan now.  A few days——"
</p>

<p>
"A few days, in which Arden may put you behind bars."  Morini
leaned against the door and began to pour flake
tobacco into a curled slip of paper.  "You underrate that
man, Chief.  He's cool—so cool he nearly gives me cold
feet.  And tough—he's just a slab of Bessemer on two legs."  He
fixed his cigarette with one deft twist and lighted it in
the same movement.  "I've met him before, and it was too
even a chance between us to make me feel comfortable!"
</p>

<p>
"Are you scared?" demanded Surcon malignantly.  "Because,
if so——"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Scared</i>," said Morini equably, "is a word folks who
know old Gat just don't use when I'm around.  But I don't
mind 'em knowing that a coffin isn't my idea of a good
time."
</p>

<p>
Surcon regarded his subordinate in silence, his big hands
locked together on the table, his heavy brows lowered.
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Let me go gunning for him, Chief," begged Morini.  "I
tell you, I won't feel comfortable in this game till Arden's
riding in a black buggy.  He'd be easy—he takes any risk.
He got Lew, but Lew always was too nervy to be much
good at close work.  I shouldn't have missed him that night."
</p>

<p>
Surcon shook his head—reluctantly, one might have
thought, but none the less definitely.  His fingers untwined,
and he flattened his palms slowly on the mahogany in a
simple gesture that conveyed better than words the utter
finality of his decision.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I'll deal with him.  He needn't be killed.  We can
hold him until the Government have paid up, and then he
can go."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have a soft spot in your heart for that
guy."  Morini flicked up an interrogative eyebrow.  "Is he
your long-lost brother or something?"
</p>

<p>
Surcon ignored the question.
</p>

<p>
"How's Rodriguez?"
</p>

<p>
"Nearly dead.  He'll go out to-night for a certainty.
Trouble is, we can't have a doc. in with that place looking like a
cross between an arsenal and a barracks."
</p>

<p>
"I'll give instructions about him by telephone."
</p>

<p>
Surcon rose and buttoned his coat.  He picked up his hat,
and Morini stood aside to give him passage.
</p>

<p>
Surcon paused in the doorway, and his eyes fixed the
gunman with a cold warning in them that was more acidly
menacing than his words.
</p>

<p>
"You understand?" he said.  "Leave Arden to me.  If you
kill him, you will die.  That's all."
</p>

<p>
Morini showed his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Is</i> he your brother, Chief?" he taunted, and then the
flame of concentrated venom that licked out of the big man's
eyes made him shrink back.  In that moment, with that one
level gaze, Surcon, unarmed in the presence of a professional
killer, showed who was master.
</p>

<p>
"No—he is my son," he said simply, and was gone.
</p>

<p>
An hour later he sat at ease in an armchair, reading over
the proclamation that was to appear in every London
newspaper the next morning.  It was a notice absolutely without
precedent in the history of crime—an ultimatum set out with
all the cold-blooded arrogant effrontery of a Note from an
unscrupulous Great Power to an insignificant Power—a
manifesto that was staggering in its presumptuous
authoritativeness, before which the imagination reeled away with
uneasy incredulity.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII
<br><br>
TOURS IN BILLINGSGATE
</h3>

<p>
Respectable young ladies of gentle nurture do not as a
rule haunt the obscure purlieus which lie east of London
Bridge, down towards the river, at one o'clock in the
morning; but then, although Susan Hawthorne might have
pleaded guilty to the gentle nurture part of the clause, it is
doubtful whether she would have admitted her respectability.
Respectability and old Smiler, her beloved father,
tutor, friend, and companion in the all-important years
between fourteen and twenty, were two factors which in the
eyes of the initiated were about as likely to merge successfully
as oil and water.  Certainly, when Adventure loomed
ahead, the teaching of old Smiler took no stock of convention.
</p>

<p>
"If there's Trouble with a big T at the end of anything,"
was his oft-inculcated maxim, "life isn't worth living
unless you're making a bee-line for it.  And if, on the way, you
come up against something you know you CAN'T do, and it's
in the way, well—DO IT, and hell to the consequences."
</p>

<p>
A pernicious doctrine by almost any ethical standard, but
one which by frequent repetition had become as much a part
of Susan's life as old Hawthorne himself.  Which goes to
explain why she sauntered down Lower Thames Street on
a certain evening on felony bent.  There was no hesitation
in her lissom stride—she even hummed a little tune.  Nerves?
You don't know her!  Susan Hawthorne, who on one occasion
had stuck up His Excellency the President of
Olvidada at the end of a six-shooter, in his own Illustrious
Palace, for six measured hours, what time she—er—persuaded
him to issue divers orders anent the constitution of
that misruled Republic—orders which made His Excellency
shudder and gasp and fume impotently—Susan Hawthorne,
I say, and nerves?  Not in your sweet natural,
stranger!  Nothing so amateurish as taut muscles, quivering
ganglions, and a disconcerting void in the gastric
regions—nothing more tremulous than a faint pleasurable
tingling of anticipation.
</p>

<p>
To the casual eye she was simply a weedy youth trudging
towards his favourite pub.  A moist and melancholy-looking
cigarette dangled from the corner of her mouth;
her face and hands were convincingly grimed; her shoulders
slouched.  The corduroy trousers were artistically torn, the
ill-fitting coat dusty and clumsily patched, the tweed cap
pulled down over her eyes in the approved rakish manner.
There were only two things about her attire to distinguish
her from the original of the part she was playing, and
neither of these obtruded itself.  One was her shoes—light
black pumps with soles as thin and flexible as rubber wafers,
which made no sound as they plodded lightly over the
cobbles—-the second was a little instrument of blued steel which
nestled against her hip, for Susan Hawthorne had spent
most of her unusual adolescence in those parts of the world
where, the wise go heeled and the foolish are all dead.
</p>

<p>
So Storm had decided that she wasn't to be in the Triangle
picnic, had he?  Well, he'd got another guess coming,
she reflected grimly.  Keep her out of it, when in her time
she'd been through more hair-raising adventures, in
company with old Smiler and Kit Arden, than she could
remember in detail?  Not much!
</p>

<p>
She was swift on the uptake, was this slim girl.  Storm
had rambled on unsuspectingly about the mysterious
warehouse in Billingsgate, and Uncle Joe had spoken sombrely
of the mysterious Mr. Raegenssen.  The faculty of adding
two and two, and unfailingly producing a tentative dozen,
was hers in a marked degree, and a few discreet investigations
had done the rest.  Oscar Raegenssen himself, that
eccentric gentleman, was the worthy burgess who numbered
that curious "saw-mill" among his goods and chattels, and
the coincidence required closer scrutiny.  There had
remained only the minor problem of the escape from the
watchful eye of Terry Mannering, and from the even more
intent care of the plain-clothes watch-dog whom Storm had
set over her....  To one of her breed, that difficulty was
exceeding small.  She chuckled reminiscently as she recalled
the simple ruse she had employed to circumvent it.
</p>

<p>
The Sud-Scandinavia Sawmill stood a little way back
from the narrow street, occupying a whole block, and
fronted by a wide stretch of pavement, not a hundred miles
from Nicholson's Wharf—a gaunt sooty building from
which by night and by day issued the muffled swoosh and
clang of a tireless plant.  A forbidden place—glancing up as
she approached, she took in its massive dullness; the
intangible air of secrecy; the barred and shuttered windows
placed high up in the walls; the single narrow rat-hole-like
entrance with its steel-mounted door.  The demesne of
Sud-Scandinavian Wood was going to be difficult.
</p>

<p>
But it took a lot to daunt Susan, once she had definitely
embarked on an enterprise.  In one lightning summary of the
situation she laid hold of the fact that nothing short of
dynamite could force an entrance into that building, if so
be the occupants earnestly desired to prevent ingress.
Dynamite, or low cunning.  Dynamite being clearly out of the
question, stealth became the order of the day.
</p>

<p>
All this she had grasped and docketed in the couple of
dozen paces it took her to reach the place, and she never
paused as she approached the small door.  Under the light of
the lone flare which guttered over the lintel, she studied the
masonry on either side and located a bell.  Her finger pressed
it with a firm touch.
</p>

<p>
A while she waited, and when no response came she
pressed again.  Straining her ears, she caught the tread of
heavy feet coming towards her.  There was something
threatening about their slow progress which would have
alarmed most people—it was as if the janitor knew that
the one outside was no regular visitor, and was suspicious.
Came the gentle slither of bolts in well-oiled grooves—she
counted four of them—and then the protesting snap of a
big lock.  The door swung back a couple of inches, and part
of a scowling face appeared in the gap.
</p>

<p>
"Vat ees?"
</p>

<p>
"An urgent message.  Hurry up and let me in, you fool!"
</p>

<p>
As the man perceived her slightness and the fact that she
was alone, the door creaked open a further six inches.
</p>

<p>
"Hom from?"
</p>

<p>
"The Chief."
</p>

<p>
"I know no Cheef," said the man, and began to close the
door again, but Susan already had her foot in the jamb.
</p>

<p>
"The Triangle, you infernal idiot," she hissed.
</p>

<p>
"Vich Triangle?"
</p>

<p>
She played her trump card.  Something silvery glittered
in her open palm as she thrust it towards the man's eyes—Joe
Blaythwayt had begged it from Mr. Teal as a memento,
and Susan had abstracted it from Uncle Joe's treasury
without that formality, in preparation for just such a
contingency.  The charm worked.  The door opened wide enough
for her to pass.
</p>

<p>
"Com."
</p>

<p>
She entered, and heard the door close and the bolts snick
back into place.  The darkness closed down inkily, and then
the shuffling of the janitor's feet stopped and a switch
clicked.  Over her head a frosted bulb broke into a dim
radiance.
</p>

<p>
Without embarrassment she crushed out the stump of
her fag on the dusty floor and took another from a gaudy
packet.  She knew that she was being inspected closely, but,
secure in the efficiency of her disguise, this fact troubled
her not at all.
</p>

<p>
At length the man seemed satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"Vid hom do you vish to spik?" he queried deferentially.
</p>

<p>
This was a development which she had not had time to
reckon with, but her brain moved fast, and she covered up
her slight hesitation by striking a match and lighting her
cigarette before replying.
</p>

<p>
"Is Prester John here?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
She was bluffing desperately on the fragmentary and
secondhand knowledge of Joe Blaythwayt, and prayed that
Prester John might be absent.  Even if he was there,
however, she had her plan mapped out by this time, and she
knew her escape was certain—which it assuredly was not
if Prester John were away and she went on with her attempt
as she had planned.
</p>

<p>
"I vill see," said the man, and she braced herself up to
the knowledge that it was now a case of no retreat, no
retreat....  "You haf not been 'ere before?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  I'm always with the Chief."
</p>

<p>
"Ze Cheef, <i>hein</i>?  A graate man, but he hass not enof
time for ze ladies, <i>non</i>?"
</p>

<p>
He leered at her, and for a moment she dreaded that he
might have penetrated her make-up.  And then she realised
that he took her for a lad of his own type and leanings, and
she smiled.  What was more, she entered her part so
thoroughly and she permitted herself a coarse reply which
would have sent the simple Joe, had he been there to hear,
purple to the ears.
</p>

<p>
"In zat room"—-he jerked his thumb—"you vill find
friends.  I vill present you."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," she agreed gruffly.  "Oh, listen.  If John
isn't here, you needn't bother to tell me.  Just send him along
as soon as he arrives.  The Chief wants him in a hurry.  If
he doesn't turn up in half an hour I'll have to leave a
message and go along and try to find him somewhere else."
</p>

<p>
He nodded, and turned to her as though an idea had
struck him.
</p>

<p>
"Zere is somzing beeg an' secret—-'ow you say?—in ze
air to-night, <i>n'est-ce-pas</i>?  You air ze second urgent messenger
ve 'ave 'ad.  Not ten meenits ago zere com a beeg man
viz 'urry call for Morini, but Morini is not yet arrive, so 'e
attend him."
</p>

<p>
"There is something in the wind," Susan said easily.
"But the Chief doesn't like questions."
</p>

<p>
The man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Somtimes I 'ave fear of 'is secrets.  Even ve do not know
quite 'ow beeg are 'is plans.  Zere is zis tunnel, now.  Even
zose 'oo work do not know vhy for eet ees mak'.  Zere ees a
new <i>ingénieur</i> down zere now 'oo mak' inspection.  Ze Cheef
send 'im wizout varning—a clevaire <i>Espagnol</i> 'e 'as recruit.
<i>Mais que faire?  'Y'a du pèse—nous sommes ses esclaves.</i>"
</p>

<p>
The Latin's halting speech broke into a torrent of
grumbling French, accompanied by much head-shaking and
gesticulation.  He was still babbling on volubly as he opened
the door he had indicated and waved her in.
</p>

<p>
She found herself in a broad, low-ceilinged room that
looked as if it had been rigged up as a doss-house at short
notice—which was the fact.  Around the walls ran a double
tier of bunks on which men slept or smoked or read
according to temperament, while others carried on a low
conversation.  In the centre of the room, under the hanging oil lamp,
stood a greasy table about which sat a dozen toughs
gambling.  The air was thick with smoke and heavy with the
nauseating reek of stale beer.  It seemed as if no window
had ever been opened upon it.  Few of the men spared her
a second glance.  The alert silence which had succeeded her
entry dissolved into a murmur of talk.
</p>

<p>
She crossed the room to a row of barrels which seemed
to do duty for chairs, and sat down, blinking through the
smoke which wreathed before her eyes from the dangling
fag-end in her mouth.  Her hand came in contact with a
bottle.  She picked it up by the neck and drained the small
quantity of bitter fluid there was left in the bottom, and set
it down again with a clatter, wiping her lips on the back of
her hand.
</p>

<p>
After a while she strolled over to the table.
</p>

<p>
She recognised the game they were playing, and was
amazed that they should know it, for thugs of that class
do not as a rule patronise Monte Carlo, and yet they were
undoubtedly on familiar terms with chemin-de-fer.  While
she watched, a burly ruffian in blue jeans swung round and
caught her arm.
</p>

<p>
"Comin' in on this yer game, cuddy?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Don't know it," she answered, playing her part
smoothly.
</p>

<p>
"Come on!" he insisted boisterously.  "Yer c'n learn,
same as I 'ad to.  It ain't much of a game, but there's dam'
few Britishers 'ere an' it soots these bloomin' furriners."
</p>

<p>
She understood then that the cosmopolitan crowd who
provided the majority of the gathering in the room were the
cause of the departure from the time-honoured gambles of
the Englishman, and to save trouble she took the place the
patriotic tough made for her.
</p>

<p>
It was getting her no farther in her quest, however, except
that it gave her time to deduce that the French janitor
had not found Prester John.  In a few minutes the gamblers
were deep in a hated wrangle about the destination of
certain stakes, and, taking advantage of the diversion, she
slipped from the bench and sidled unostentatiously to the
door.
</p>

<p>
The passage outside was in darkness, but in a moment a
thin pencil of light flicked out from her hand, roving across
the walls.  The man who had admitted her had not entered
the doss-room, so she gathered that other rooms were
similarly equipped.  It would be necessary to proceed warily.
Directly across the corridor her torch revealed a door like
the one through which she had just passed, and, stealing
forward, she heard through it a subdued hum of talk.  That,
at least, was a spot to avoid.  Turning to her right, the beam
showed that the far end of the passage twisted abruptly to
the left, and she crept towards the bend, using the flashlight
sparingly.
</p>

<p>
Round the corner the corridor widened out into a spacious
hall.  To one side a flight of stone stairs ran upwards;
opposite these, another flight ran down into blackness.  On each
side were two doors, and a fifth door faced her—an
incongruously elegant portal of polished oak adorned with
grotesque carvings and half masked by rich velvet hangings.
The soles of her supple shoes made no more than a
soft slithering sound on the concrete floor as she moved
forward.  At the end she paused undecidedly.  That fifth door
was intriguing; intriguing also, after the janitor's vague
references to a tunnel, was the flight of stairs that disappeared
in the direction of the vaults.  Susan solved the problem
in a reckless way that would have earned the admiration
of Smiler: she took a coin from her pocket and held it
between her palms.
</p>

<p>
"Heads the stairs, tails the door," she murmured, and
opened her eyes....
</p>

<p>
Heads.
</p>

<p>
A whiff of dank, clammy air met her as she felt her way
over the first step.  Luckily, the stairs were concrete, as was
the upward flight, and there was no danger of creaking
boards or a rotten tread.  Her light showed her a small
landing where the direction reversed.  She took the corner and
continued downwards.
</p>

<p>
The cellars seemed to extend over the whole ground space
of the building, most of the weight of which appeared to be
taken by a number of massive pillars.  She could only guess
at the actual area, for little but the ceiling was visible.  Every
available cubic inch of space was filled from the floor with
great mounds of earth, tightly packed.  There must have
been tons of it, piled and compressed into stacks.  All the
thoroughfare that remained was a narrow lane which wound
between the huge dumps, and these had been buttressed up
on either side of the path so that the last fraction of volume
might be utilised.  Down this lane danger lay, for in that
insignificant width there was not much chance of avoiding
anyone who happened to be coming towards her.  Moreover,
the path was lighted at intervals by electric bulbs fixed
to the side boarding.  Switching off her torch, she
transferred her automatic from her hip to her jacket pocket,
where it would be quicker to reach, and went on.
</p>

<p>
There was a silence in that weird cavern, which was
accentuated rather than relieved by the dull rumble of the
plant overhead.  That the true purpose of this plant was
to provide power she gathered from the insulated cables
which snaked along on each side.
</p>

<p>
Presently a yawning hole, fitfully lighted by bulbs
suspended from its earthen roof, confronted her.  So this was
the tunnel of which the Keeper of the Door had spoken.
She entered it resolutely.  The quality of the air had altered
subtly: it had taken on a puzzling, faint, acid tang, which
she could not account for until she came to the exit.  She
must have travelled three hundred yards before that, and
then she noticed that there was only darkness in front, and
the bulbs no longer hung from above.  She switched on her
flash again, and a moment later she left the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
A blank, tile-faced wall was before her, and she looked
from right to left in surprise.  She was in a second tunnel
which ran almost at right angles to the one she had left,
and at distances lights hung on the walls.  She bent the
rays of her torch downwards, and they were reflected by
three parallel ribbons of gleaming metal.
</p>

<p>
And then she understood.  She was in the Tube!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII
<br><br>
INTEREST IN "H"
</h3>

<p>
Making a closer examination with the aid of her flash, she
realised her good fortune, for a heavy circular door hung
back against the tiling of the tube tunnel.  Swinging it
cautiously, she found that when closed it fitted snugly into
the round gap where the Sud-Scandinavia burrow debouched
into the City and South London Railway, so that
without a minute study of the surface it was impossible to
know that a door existed at all.  Remembering that between
the hours of two and five ack emma, when the Tube is
closed, there are repair gangs moving about its subterranean
ways, she realised the necessity for some such camouflage,
and guessed that the door had only been left open by an
oversight.  Scrutinising the inside of it, she found that it
was fitted with a strong iron bolt.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing to be gained by remaining, and she
retraced her steps with all speed.  On the return journey she
noticed that two irregular ruts ran on either side of the
earthen floor of the boarded lane.  Some heavy-wheeled
vehicle had made that trip frequently, but what it might be
she had no notion.
</p>

<p>
As she went, her head was whirling like a ball-race.  A
clean-cut tunnel down which ran power cables, which came
to a dead end in the Tube!  The enigma was to her
temporarily insoluble, and she had no time to sit down and
make a calm, collected study of the facts from all their
angles.  All she knew was that she had stumbled on the trail
of something big, and the most imperative thing at that
moment was to get clear with her knowledge and pass it on
to more brilliant and capable heads.  At least, she would have
a short laugh over Storm—he would have to admit that
even in circumstances of the magnitude of the Alpha Triangle
she had her uses.  But, after that brief period of
exasperation on the one side and self-congratulation on the
other, she had no doubt that Storm was the one man to
deal with the situation accurately and efficiently.  The
steel-keen precision of his mind, no less than the steel-strong
virility of his physique, brooked no uneasiness on that score.
If she got out, of course, and when....
</p>

<p>
At the top of the stairs she paused, but it was only a
momentary hesitation.
</p>

<p>
There remained still that intriguing door, and, anyway,
she was fairly and squarely in the swim by now.  "When
you're in the soup, get all the nourishment out of it you
can," was another of Smiler's adages, and on it she acted.
Having commenced the reconnaissance in such style, one
might as well conclude it thoroughly.
</p>

<p>
The door opened so lightly to her touch that for a second
she was suspicious.  An instant later she was reproving
herself in no uncertain terms for this tentative sign of waning
determination, and, taking a grip on the butt of her little
automatic, she pushed the door wide and entered.  And then
she had her work cut out to suppress an exclamation.
</p>

<p>
The room in which she stood was spacious and roughly
square.  The walls were hung from ceiling to floor with
luxurious curtains of royal purple velvet embroidered with
golden arabesques.  The orange carpet underfoot had a
wealth of soft pile that was indescribably pleasant to tread
upon.  A double rank of cushioned chairs ran the length of
the room, and a broad gangway paved with costly furs led
between them towards the far end.  The restful half-light
which showed her all these things was supplied by three
magnificent chandeliers ranged overhead.  It was a room
like nothing she had ever seen or even imagined, something
that in its splendour suggested a mingling of the essentials
of a temple and of an Oriental palace.  It was an outrage at
the same time—an outrage against all preconceived standards,
against all logic and all norms.  It was a concrete
paradox that mocked comprehension and yet was fascinating
by sheer daring originality.  Its gorgeous simplicity—its
ascetic voluptuousness—its Philistine reverence—these
were contradictions which numbed understanding and
defied criticism.
</p>

<p>
Dumb with wonder, she simply stared.  Her awed gaze
travelled again and again over every detail, and then she
looked at the opposite wall—the one facing the door—towards
which she had not yet looked.  And there she saw
something which harmonised so perfectly with the atmosphere
that it was evident that the room had been designed
and decorated to house it, and which at the same time
explained the perplexing counter-impressions.
</p>

<p>
At that end of the room, facing the banks of seats, was
a daïs hung with black, and in the centre of it stood a huge
gilded throne.  And to the right of this throne was the
keystone which held the whole architectural monstrosity
together and gave its reason and its justification.
</p>

<p>
It was a gigantic equilateral triangle of silver which
seemed to be suspended in vacancy without material
support, being probably braced by brackets concealed behind
the hangings.  It must have been fully five feet of base, and
in the centre of it was a Greek <i>alpha</i>, similarly made of
silver.
</p>

<p>
She was in the council chamber of the Triangle—that
exotic room which nothing but the brain of a madman
could have visualised and brought to substance—the
cathedral of a megalomaniac....
</p>

<p>
And then she saw something else, which up to then had
not caught her eye, for the shadows at that end of the
room were deeper and the interior of the throne itself was
shrouded in gloom.  But he moved, and she saw him—the
man who lounged on the throne—and then he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, Susan—what do you want?"
</p>

<p>
Her eyes dilated, for although the figure and face of the
man were the figure and face of the tousled scoundrel who
had invited her to play <i>chemin-de-fer</i>, the voice was the
voice of Joe Blaythwayt.
</p>

<p>
"Uncle—Joe?" she breathed.
</p>

<p>
He lumbered ponderously off the daïs and came towards
her.
</p>

<p>
"I recognised you in that other room," he said, "and I've
been looking for you.  What on earth did you want to come
here for?"
</p>

<p>
"What did you want to come for?" she parried.
</p>

<p>
He waved a hand.
</p>

<p>
"Men are Different," he said grandly.  "How did you get
in?  Oh, I suppose you were the little devil who pinched my
badge?"  He wagged a fat forefinger at her.  "Naughty!  I
had no end of a job getting in without it."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen the tunnel?" she asked.
</p>

<p>
"Only a bit of it.  I was exploring down there when I
heard someone padding towards me, and beat it back.  It
must have been you.  Tunnel?  That's interesting.  Where
does it go to?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't the foggiest."  Her amazement abated, she
took command of the situation automatically.  "What we've
got to do is to get out of here quick, and talk afterwards.
Rustle!  Storm's got to hear of this at once."
</p>

<p>
"And Teal," put in Blaythwayt loyally.
</p>

<p>
"And Teal, if you like.  Come along—behind me," she
directed impatiently, and the docile Joe followed her.
</p>

<p>
They were nearing the door when there came heavy footsteps
behind them, and the light of a hand lamp swept the
corridor just behind them.  There were men talking, also,
in a language she did not understand.  Blaythwayt stopped
in his tracks, apparently frozen with terror, and she gripped
his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Into that room!" she whispered.  "They know us there."
</p>

<p>
She was opening the door when the approaching rays
veered upwards and fell full on herself and the trembling
Joe.  A hoarse challenge echoed down the passage.
Unconcernedly the girl took her yellow packet of gaspers from her
pocket and began to light one as she waited for the men to
come up with them.  And then, as they arrived and grouped
themselves about the door, she returned the box of matches
to her right-hand jacket pocket—and kept her hand there.
</p>

<p>
The bright light searched their faces.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you?" demanded a cultured voice with only a
slight accent.  "I don't know you."
</p>

<p>
"I know 'em," said another, and added a few words she
could not interpret.
</p>

<p>
The frosted bulb overhead woke to life, and they were
relieved of the merciless glare of the interrogator's
spotlight.  She looked about for the one who had claimed to
know them, but none of that dishevelled dozen seemed likely
to possess so smooth a voice.  And then he spoke again—a
man clad only in his trousers and a greasy singlet, who stood
half a head above the rest.
</p>

<p>
"They are special messengers of the Apex.  Who admitted them?"
</p>

<p>
"I did."  It was the janitor, whom she had not recognised
through the smears of engine oil which disfigured his face,
who spoke.  "Zat was 'ow zey zemselves called.  Ze beeg one
'ave ask for Morini, and ze mignon for Prestaire Jean."
</p>

<p>
"That's in order.  John and Morini won't be here to-night—I
know where to find them.  You'd better go."
</p>

<p>
It was a miracle to Susan, for the man's face was
unknown to her.  And yet there was something vaguely
familiar about the cast of it.  Just that indefinable carriage of
the broad shoulders, the lithe swing of the powerful arms—and
yet the lank, oily black hair struck no chord in her
memory.  She looked at his eyes more closely ... <i>gun-metal
grey</i>....
</p>

<p>
Surely only one man in the world had eyes of the curious
tint, and, taken with the other resemblances in poise of
head and general bearing....
</p>

<p>
He met her gaze calmly, and she could have sworn that
the flicker of a smile feinted at the corners of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go with you, if you like to wait a minute," he said.
"I'll just get my coat."
</p>

<p>
A few seconds later he was back, folding a scarf round
his bare throat and buttoning his coat tightly around it.
Only one man returned with him, as if receiving his final
instructions, and now that she had caught an answering "<i>Si
señor</i>," she gathered that they were speaking in Spanish.
</p>

<p>
The man unbarred the front door for them, and they
passed out, Storm going last.  A curt exchange of "<i>Buenos
noches</i>," and the bolts slithered home on the inside.
</p>

<p>
Storm led them briskly to the corner of the block and
halted.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he ordered, "you can get in a taxi and go home,
and thank your gods you're going to bed alive!"
</p>

<p>
"There's a tunnel," Joe began excitedly, but Storm cut
him short.
</p>

<p>
"I know all about the tunnel, and about the synthetic
mosque, and about the power plant, <i>and</i> about the
doss-house crew, and about the arsenal," was his categorical
retort.  "I also know that there isn't going to be a second
Battle of Sidney Street if I can help it.  Our separate bluffs may
be shown up at any moment, and then there'll be Hell to
pay!  I've got to get busy, and you'll hinder me.  Step on it!"
</p>

<p>
"But can't I stay and see the——"
</p>

<p>
"Nope!  Vamos!"
</p>

<p>
Joe looked hurt.
</p>

<p>
"This is the first time I've ever been near any
excitement," he protested weakly.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Get—in—a—taxi—and—beat it</i>," snarled Storm, and
Blaythwayt moved aggrievedly away.
</p>

<p>
The girl had watched this brief encounter in amusement
blended with annoyance.  After all, it was only luck that
had put Storm on the spot at the same time as herself, and
it wasn't fair.  She had taken exactly the same risks as if
he had been a hundred miles away, and she wasn't going to
be cheated out of her reward.
</p>

<p>
"All right—we'll beat it," she said defiantly.  "But we'll
come back!"
</p>

<p>
"Let me see you, and you'll spend the night in a police
station!" Storm flung at them over his shoulder as he strode
away.
</p>

<p>
From the Custom House he phoned the nearest Division
and rapped out his requirements in terse, staccato sentences.
Then he got through to the Yard, and tried to get Inspector
Teal, but Teal, tired of waiting, had gone home to bed.
Storm called a third number, and presently the detective's
drowsy grumble answered him.
</p>

<p>
"Come right down to the Sud-Scandinavia Sawmill in
Lower Thames Street," he directed.  "There's going to be
fun!"
</p>

<p>
"Is that Raegenssen's place?"  Teal's voice took on a
more alert note.
</p>

<p>
"Yeh!  I've sent a man round to take him, though I doubt
if Olaf's still rooted in Finchley.  Flying Squad and all
divisional reserves are on their way.  Bring a gun.  The mill's
like a fort, and there's over a hundred roughnecks inside.
Now burn the roads!"
</p>

<p>
In less than half an hour the first detachment of urgently
summoned men had arrived, and thereafter reinforcements
kept coming in batches—broad-shouldered, phlegmatic men
who took the unusual circumstances with great philosophy,
as though it were merely a slight deviation from routine.
Some were in uniform—these had been hurriedly called in
from minor duties—the rest were in plain clothes.  All were
armed, in accordance with Storm's telephoned warning.
</p>

<p>
Knowing that precipitancy might be fatal, he waited until
he had mustered a hundred men.  Seventy of these he told
off to draw an inconspicuous cordon round the whole block,
and thirty he sent down to cover the Tube bolt-hole at
London Bridge Station.  A batch of twenty of the Flying Squad
arriving in a van at that moment, he sent them on to occupy
a similar position at Bank Station.  The mention of the
word flashed a blaze of inspiration across his mind.
</p>

<p>
"Bank!" he repeated to himself.  "Jerusalem, what a man!"
</p>

<p>
It would be some time before the men could take up their
stations, and he filled in the period of inaction by smoking
a cigarette with calm enjoyment, and discussing the probable
result of a local bye-election with a night watchman.
</p>

<p>
On the stroke of 3.45 he trod out his cigarette end, bade
the watchman a cheery good-night, and made a supplementary
disposition of the men who had reached the Custom
House in the meanwhile.  He was just leaving when Inspector
Teal dashed up in a taxi, the disarray of his attire
testifying to the haste of his start.
</p>

<p>
"In time?" queried that officer swiftly, and Storm
nodded.
</p>

<p>
"To the tick.  We are now going into action."
</p>

<p>
They walked together to Raegenssen's block.  It was just
getting light.
</p>

<p>
Storm paused before the door and lighted another cigarette.
Then he jerked back the jacket of his automatic,
slipped the safety catch, and pushed Teal to one side.
</p>

<p>
"No use both of us being shot up," he said, and pressed
the bell.
</p>

<p>
This time there was little delay.  The muffled foot-steps
of the French janitor came down the passage; the three-inch
bars swished back in their steel grooves; the lock
clicked.  As before, the door swung back a bare, suspicious
two inches.
</p>

<p>
Storm moved so that the light from the gas jet overhead
fell across his face, and the door opened wider as the
man recognised him.
</p>

<p>
Storm pushed into the gap, blocking the door open with
his foot.  The surprised janitor felt a sinewy hand grasp his
windpipe caressingly, and a menace he understood equally
well glinted before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Sois sage—et vis!</i>" hissed Storm in his ear, and the man
signified his acceptance of this advice.
</p>

<p>
He was handed back to Mr. Teal, who in turn passed him
on to a bulky shadow which rose from the ground.
</p>

<p>
Storm, with Teal hard on his heels, led the way into the
building, and a number of dim shapes materialised from the
adjoining alley and followed them.  So far, all had been
admirably plain sailing, but luck was not with them that
night.  Storm was groping round for the switch which
controlled the corridor light, when an over-eager constable
tripped over the doorstep and crashed down among his
fellows.  The thud sounded like a detonation in the silence, and
Teal turned and cursed the offender in pregnant whispers.
Storm found the lever he sought, and pulled it down.
</p>

<p>
"Teal—left-hand door," he called.  "This way, some of
you boys!"
</p>

<p>
He himself turned the handle of the right-hand door and
kicked it open.  The men were pouring into the passage
behind him.
</p>

<p>
He saw how much that fall had cost them, and sprang
into the room.  There was another door to it, and most of
the roughnecks had already passed through it.  Scarcely half
a dozen were left, scrambling to get through.  Storm caught
the hindmost and tripped him.  A couple of burly forms
promptly sat on the prostrate one.
</p>

<p>
The next instant something banged close to Storm's
head, and he felt the wind of the bullet and jumped back,
drawing as he did so.
</p>

<p>
The panic had stopped suddenly.  The half-dozen who
had been fighting to get through the second door were now
filing out in an orderly manner, and every one of them was
armed.  The men behind Storm hesitated for a second, for
the London bobby is not anxious to use firearms, and it
seemed to be the only course left open.  They were waiting
for orders, and Storm, having none of their scruples, roared
them on.
</p>

<p>
"Feet—first round—don't hit 'em!" he snapped, and a
volley rang out.
</p>

<p>
The retreating men retaliated on the echo, shooting
in deadly earnest, and Storm heard the cries of the stricken
men behind him.  He fired back himself, gunning now to
wound, and saw a man drop with a scream.  But the
retaliatory salvo had done its work; and in the momentary
consternation, before the officers could return the fire, those
who were left of the half-dozen won through the door.
</p>

<p>
Storm reached it a second late, and it slammed in his face.
On the other side a bar thudded home.
</p>

<p>
"The table—smash it in!" he ordered.
</p>

<p>
While they battered at the thick wood he left the room
and crossed the passage to see how Inspector Teal was faring.
Teal had been more, and at the same time less, fortunate.
He had no casualties, but the reason was that those
who had occupied the room had escaped too swiftly for
him, and the way of pursuit was barred by a door on which
his men were already working.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven knows where these let out," said Storm.  "It
may be the tunnel, of course.  Here—bring three of your
men and we'll go and see."
</p>

<p>
They sprinted down the corridor, and so bore the brunt
of the flank attack which the Triangle, with amazing daring
and presence of mind, had organised.  Just as they turned
the angle of the passage an armed mob streamed from a side
door and let fly at them on sight.
</p>

<p>
The five dodged back behind the bend, and, leaning over
each other, fired from cover.  The police were shooting to
kill now, and in the face of that withering hurricane of
death the assault faltered and broke.
</p>

<p>
The survivors retreated to the door through which they
had come, and Storm caught Teal by the arm.
</p>

<p>
"Great stuff!  Go back and get the others; just leave a
few on guard in the rooms.  Oh, and whistle more men in
from the outside."
</p>

<p>
Teal departed obediently, and Storm coolly reloaded.  He
was breathing evenly, and there was hardly a flush on his
face.  On an impulse he decided to reconnoitre upstairs, and
thereby saved his life.
</p>

<p>
He was half-way up when the door below him opened
and a man appeared.  In a moment the apparition had vanished
again, but Storm had seen the round black object that
had been flung towards the angle he had just quitted.  He
yelled a warning, and at the same time fired through the
door.  He heard a bellow of pain, and gathered that his
random shot had found a billet.  Then the bomb exploded.
</p>

<p>
Lying flat on the stairs, he blazed between the banisters
at the second mass which crowded out to attack, until his
automatic clicked on an empty magazine.  By this time a
fresh contingent had arrived under Inspector Teal, and
once again the onslaught was repulsed with losses on each
side.  But now, instead of retiring to their door, most of the
party broke for the stairs, running the gauntlet of the
police fire.
</p>

<p>
Storm leapt up ahead of them, for there was no hope of
resistance: there must have been fully eighty men in that
solid pack.  He had hoped for a single door which he could
have held against them, but a long passage fronted him as
he reached the top.  A side door which was ajar showed a
bare room, and he dodged into it, barring the door behind
him, and heard the mob go pounding past.  Reloading at
speed, he opened the door again and fired low as the last
of them disappeared through another opening, and two fell
to his shooting.  Then Teal and a number of men arrived,
and he led them in a rush to the door and tried the handle.
It was locked.
</p>

<p>
"There may be another bomb coming, so look out!" he
warned, and promptly disregarded his own advice.
</p>

<p>
The lock burst out under the impact of a bullet, and
they charged in.
</p>

<p>
The place was beautifully empty.
</p>

<p>
"This is annoying," said Teal with staggering restraint,
and walked to the only window.
</p>

<p>
Hanging out, he looked to his left and saw that the wall
continued over to the next block, with an archway below
at the street level.  He pointed this fact out to Storm,
thereby annoying that young man considerably.
</p>

<p>
"The place is marked as an island site on the surveyor's
plans," he said.  "They must have sent me an old set.  You
can see the bridge is newer than either building.  I suppose
there's a secret panel somewhere, but we needn't waste time
looking for it now.  What about the birds who didn't get
away?"
</p>

<p>
"The boys have got 'em—thirteen.  They were unlucky,
all right."
</p>

<p>
"And eighty-odd have slipped the cordon, you long-tailed
land-ape!" snarled Storm with pardonable heat.
"Your sense of proportion makes me want to scream!"
</p>

<p>
His first thought was for the men under him, but he
found that an ambulance had been sent along by a thoughtful
authority, and Red Cross men were already tending the
casualties.  Six of the constables were killed, and a number
were more or less seriously wounded.  Then he went along
to the room where the thirteen unlucky ones were under
guard awaiting the arrival of a van.  Their spirit left
nothing to be desired.
</p>

<p>
"You might as well let us go, guvnor," said one hefty
specimen.  "It'll only mean trouble if you take us to the
station."
</p>

<p>
"Yeh!" agreed Storm ironically.  "And the trouble will
be right up under your hats!"
</p>

<p>
The man looked at him queerly.
</p>

<p>
"D'you really think you'll get us to the station?" he
asked, and Storm showed his teeth.
</p>

<p>
"I'll think more than that, for your benefit," he said
unpleasantly.  "I think in about two months' time you will all
hang by your necks until you are dead!"
</p>

<p>
Teal, on a round of inspection, stopped Storm to air a
theory.  The detective was taking the set-back with great
patience.  He stripped the wrapping from a wafer of
chewing-gum and inserted the sweet in his mouth with care.
</p>

<p>
"Has it occurred to you," he said, "that even a lot of
thugs like that bunch wouldn't be armed to the teeth, every
man of 'em, in the ordinary way, if they'd thought they
were all snug and chummy?"
</p>

<p>
This was a far-fetched suggestion, Storm opined, but
Teal's confidence was undamped.  He went to the telephone
in the hall and called Exchange.
</p>

<p>
"Central-Inspector Teal," he introduced himself.  "Has
this number been called in the last hour? ... Thank you....
Ah! ... public call box at Monument Station you
said? ... Thanks."
</p>

<p>
"Three bluffs were put over in this shack to-night,"
Storm murmured thoughtfully as Teal replaced the receiver.
"I don't think it matters which one that call gave away."  He
looked at the detective sombrely.  "Teal!  This is Hell's
own song and dance act!  They were waiting for us, and
they guessed they could make a slick enough getaway when
the time came; they just stayed on to liven things up a bit
for us.  That's nerve!  I wish the swine didn't seem so
damned sure of themselves."
</p>

<p>
"You surprise me—after that speech of yours at the
Enquiry," Teal said drily.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards one of the Flying Squad's vans
arrived with the detachment which had guarded the Bank
Station.  The officers were unloaded, and the captured
members of the Triangle shipped instead, with two armed men
for company.  A third armed man rode beside the driver.
</p>

<p>
Huge drays with their attendant school of porters were
already about, blocking the narrow street, and the van
made slow progress.  Storm watched it go with a frown,
for the confident words of one of the prisoners stuck in his
head.  A second van arriving at that moment, he sent it on
the trail of the first for additional security, but by that
time there was a thick jam of slow traffic between the two,
and in those circumstances he had some doubts of the
efficiency of his precaution.
</p>

<p>
"If they do get away, I'll believe I'm dreaming a
detective story," he told himself.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the prisoners did escape, and by a ruse so
simple that it was almost certain to succeed.
</p>

<p>
The leading van made for Headquarters via Tower Hill
and Eastcheap, to avoid the obstructions of Lower Thames
Street as much as possible—a move which the strategist
would have foreseen.  At the turn into Tower Street it
encountered a lorry laden with men, who to the casual eye
were navvies on their way to work, but who must almost
certainly have been a section of the crowd which had made
its getaway through the secret door in the upper storey of
the sawmill.  As the van containing the prisoners took the
bend, its escort being still held up in the wedge of Billingsgate
traffic, the lorry seemed to get out of hand, and swerved
across the road.  It caught the Flying Squad van squarely
across the bonnet, throwing the whole vehicle round in a
complete circle which fetched up in a smash against a
lamp-post.  The driver of the police van and the man who sat
beside him were thrown out and dangerously injured; the two
armed men inside, half-stunned by the shock, were quickly
overpowered by the "navvies" who swarmed from the
lorry.  The rescue party and their friends then reëntered
the lorry, which in the meantime had been backed out of
the wreckage, and which by reason of its superior weight
and the angle of impact had suffered no great damage, and
were driven off.  The rescue was conducted with such
well-organised speed that it was obvious that some such
contingency had been feared and prepared for, and the proceedings
rehearsed beforehand.  From start to finish the incident
took no longer than three minutes, and the lorry was
rushing away through the deserted streets before any of the
few spectators could recover from their astonishment.  The
lorry was driven round the Tower and across Tower Bridge,
and later in the day was found abandoned outside a builder's
yard in Bermondsey.
</p>

<p>
All this, of course, neither Storm nor Inspector Teal
heard until some time afterwards.
</p>

<p>
"There's two more bits of news for you," Teal said in
his homeward taxi.  "One is that Miss Hawthorne's slipped
her man and disappeared."
</p>

<p>
"I knew that," said Storm, although for the first time
since the opening of that brief, hectic battle he remembered
Susan's threat to return.  "What else?"
</p>

<p>
"This."  Teal fished in his pocket and brought out a
grubby scrap of paper on which a message was typewritten.
"Birdie tried to get this put in the <i>Era</i> agony column.  The
clerk smelt rats and phoned us."
</p>

<p>
Storm read:
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
Allay contemptible inanity.  Groan in it ping, correct, a a a,
ping, a a a.  Attaboy consuming, brass band ping, a, loving
wine.  Cry alas, glory me, ping.  Alone.  Weeping, days are long,
2.  Try again, a ping, presumably futility.  A ping a ping.  It is
hope, frustrated, pong sadly, ping, drying tears.  Inside, to see
pong ping, a, come and be blest.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"Has Birdie taken to free verse," he asked mildly, when
he had perused the amazing document a second time, "or
are we both mad?"
</p>

<p>
Teal shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Nor is Birdie in love, as far as I can make out," he said.
</p>

<p>
At the Albany, Storm invited the detective upstairs, for
he felt like anything but endeavouring to put in a few
hours' sleep before commencing the next day's work.
</p>

<p>
"You may as well wait a bit and have breakfast with
me," he said as they went in.  "Has anyone else been getting
busy on this little puzzle?"
</p>

<p>
"It's a code, of course," said Teal unnecessarily, and
Storm stopped in the hall to wring his hand in mute admiration.
</p>

<p>
"You're a genius!" he declared brokenly when he had
found his voice.
</p>

<p>
Comfortably ensconced in a deep armchair, with one of
Storm's cigars between his teeth, the somnambulous
Mr. Teal became less trite.
</p>

<p>
"Our tame expert's on the job, but he's nowhere near it
yet.  Said it was like nothing in his experience.  It's
something absolutely new.  I suppose it's simple enough really,
but these experts have such conventionally eccentric minds
that the obvious always gets by them."
</p>

<p>
"Thank God I'm not an expert," said Storm fervently.
</p>

<p>
He mixed himself a drink, carried the cigarette box over
to the centre table, lighted a smoke, and began to work.
</p>

<p>
He was silent for a long time, and then he leaned back,
staring at the ceiling.  The pencil in his hand drummed
against his teeth, began to beat out a meditative tattoo.
The sound interested him, apparently, to the exclusion of
everything else, and then suddenly he brought his chair
back to the vertical and permitted himself a soft
"Jerusalem!" of satisfaction.  He wrote swiftly for a few
moments, and then turned to the expectant Teal.
</p>

<p>
"Who are the H's we know in this case?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Teal pondered.
</p>

<p>
"There's Harry the Toff—I think he's in.  And Horring,
the hold-up man—he's reformed lately, which always makes
me think of Triangles these days.  Oh, and Hannassay; but
Hannassay's dead and buried.  That's all I can remember
off-hand."
</p>

<p>
"I can add one to that list," said Storm, and crossed to
the telephone.
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence, and then he was speaking into
the instrument.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo—Terry?  What on earth are you up for at this
hour? ... Oh, I see....  Yes, I'll bet there was some
vertical breeze!  Got home all right, though? ... Mmm—alone?
... Not even Uncle Joe? ... Lazy piker!  Look here, can I
speak to her?  Is she up still? ... Right."  He covered the
transmitter with his hand while he waited, and addressed
Teal.  "This is the H you couldn't remember off-hand," he
remarked.  "I want another man to watch her, and I'll
have the coats off their backs if she slips 'em again!"
</p>

<p>
"Miss Hawthorne?" queried Teal, mildly interested.
</p>

<p>
"That same....  Hullo.  Yes....  Splendid!  But listen,
Susan, I'm coming round right after breakfast, and I'm
going to get your goat! ... No, but you've got to play the
game!  Now look here, where did Joe leave you? ... Tower
Hill? ... So you didn't keep your
promise? ... Jerusalem—who? ... Damn it....  Oh,
all right.  S'long!"
</p>

<p>
He hung up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Saw the getaway and recognised someone," he explained
as he came back.  "This code, now.  It's Morse.
Short and long syllables equal dots and dashes.  But some
of the signals are too long to get into one word, so <i>ping</i> or
<i>a</i> equals <i>dot</i>, and <i>pong</i> equals <i>dash</i>.  When more than one
word or letter goes to make up a signal the phrase is
enclosed in commas.  Groan in it ping, for instance, is
<i>dash-dot-dot-dot</i>.  The words are easy.  <i>Allay:
dot-dash—contemptibly: dot-dash-dot-dot</i>—and so
forth.  Here's the
whole shoot, in case you can't read Morse."
</p>

<p>
He tossed over a slip of paper, and Teal read the scribbled
words with interest.
</p>

<p>
"<i>All bases.  Urgent.  Take A.  No. 2.  Kill H.  Urgent.
Apex.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Clever," was Teal's grudging comment.  "What do we
do about it, Chief?"
</p>

<p>
"Give it back to Birdie and try to kid him you've decided
it was innocent.  That'll be a job, but it'll have to be done.
If the orders don't go out through the Era, they'll go out
some way else, and knowing their code 'll be useful if they
try it on again.  I'm A, of course, and I'm to be taken.  But
who is 2—or is it a place?"
</p>

<p>
"Most likely another nest of theirs.  There are probably
several—the Triangle wouldn't risk everything on one
being unsuspected."
</p>

<p>
"Probably," Storm agreed.  "And H is to die—being
apparently more dangerous than me.  There's a bouquet!"
</p>

<p>
It was nearing seven, and he went up the outside stairs
to call his manservant and order breakfast.  Cork was
already astir, and in an astonishingly short time steaming
coffee and delicate slices of golden-brown toast were on the
table, and a great dish of fried eggs and bacon was set
before them, still sizzling seductively from the pan.
</p>

<p>
"This will about save my life," Teal said appreciatively,
and heaved himself from his chair.
</p>

<p>
Across the food Storm regarded him.
</p>

<p>
"If Miss Hawthorne is the H referred to," he said,
"there're going to be a whole lot of three-cornered funerals
in the near future.  And the Big Triangle 'll be among those
present!  From now on I'm going gunning for Triangles!"
</p>

<p>
The detective stared, for if he had seen the words in cold
print he would have refused to believe that they could be
invested with such a crisp, arctic, incisive malevolence.
Storm's voice was very quiet, very suave—but the quietness
was like that which comes between the flash of
lightning and the answering crackle of its destruction; and the
suaveness was not of velvet, but of polished metal....
</p>

<p>
"The Law," began the respectable Mr. Teal feebly, and
then stopped, having met the frosty gaze of those level
grey eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Skunkrot the Law!" said Storm, very gently.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br><br>
EXASPERATION OF MR. TEAL
</h3>

<p>
James Mattock read the second proclamation of the
Alpha Triangle in his morning paper.
</p>

<p>
It was headed in the flamboyant fashion of the first, but
it was much less circumlocutory.  Its comparative brevity
lent it a force which had been lacking in its predecessor—a
force which gained much from the incidents which had come
between the two, and which was emphasised by the account
of the Battle of Billingsgate and the subsequent escape of
the thirteen prisoners, a scoop that occupied the place of
honour next to the manifesto itself.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
SECOND MANIFESTO
</p>

<p>
Followed, in the facsimile which was blazoned across
the front page of the <i>Mercury</i>, the sign of the Alpha
Triangle.
</p>

<p>
Mattock read the whole epistle through a second time.
Not that it interested him—he already knew it by heart—but
because for the first time he had been struck by an
almost insignificant detail of the layout.  Searching in his
wallet for the clipping of the first manifesto, he compared
the two, and the confirmation of his idea made him sit very
still for some time.
</p>

<p>
When he reached the Cockspur Street office that morning,
he found that Raegenssen had not arrived, and the police
were in possession.  Shortly afterwards, Inspector Teal
himself entered, and promptly buttonholed the ex-convict.
</p>

<p>
"The last time your boss was in was yesterday, wasn't
it?" he drawled.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What business did he do that day?"
</p>

<p>
Mattock looked at the detective.
</p>

<p>
"I've no right to talk about my employer's business," he
said.
</p>

<p>
"No-o?"  Teal's voice was silky.  "But we want to know
all about it—we're just buzzing with interest, in fact—and
you look most like the man who's going to tell us."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry about that."
</p>

<p>
"What did Raegenssen do yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
"Rotten weather, isn't it?" said Mattock absently, and
turned the papers on his desk.
</p>

<p>
Teal shifted his chewing-gum with a deliberate clamp
of his jaws.
</p>

<p>
"Did he go to the bank by any chance?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose," murmured Mattock, staring reflectively out
of the window, "I suppose the ducks like it."
</p>

<p>
"You listen to me, and look at this!  You know a warrant
by this time, don't you?  And d'you know what you'll
get, with your record, if I use it?  Marchmont Avenue,
Hampstead, at the house of Oscar Raegenssen—burglary
and assault—five years."
</p>

<p>
Mattock regarded the paper in the detective's hand
calmly.  Then he looked at Teal.  James Mattock, convicted
criminal and sometime jail-bird though he was, had once
been a gentleman, according to Teal's own description, and
the fact gave him an immeasurable pull over the detective.
Teal, blunt and burly, a man of the people who had won
his rank from the academy of the beat, felt uncomfortable
under the steady once-over of the self-possessed clerk.
</p>

<p>
"You know," said Mattock kindly, "your tact would
make an angel weep."
</p>

<p>
Teal had one pose which never failed to conceal his
embarrassment.  His heavy-lidded eyes half-closed, his whole
figure relaxed—he looked as if he were on the point of
falling asleep on his feet.  Everything in the world seemed to
bore him to tears.
</p>

<p>
"All right, Jimmy," he said wearily.  "We can't make you
squeal if you don't want to.  The only thing that struck me
was that giving us a bit of help now would cut a lot of ice.
I mean, we could give you a hand in return—maybe go
blind a trifle the next time you skated near trouble."
</p>

<p>
"There won't be a next time," was Mattock's uncompromising
retort.
</p>

<p>
"All clear, then, Jimmy.  But don't forget what I said.
The offer's always open."
</p>

<p>
It seemed to Teal that Mattock had watched the whole
performance with cynical enjoyment, and the clerk's
answer verified that impression.
</p>

<p>
"If <i>you're</i> ever in trouble, Teal," he said, "go along to
a music-hall manager.  If you get an audition, and your
form's up to to-day's, your fortune's made."
</p>

<p>
Feeling that he had not had the best of the encounter,
Teal stalked into the inner office, where detectives were
already at work examining the filing cabinets and the drawers
of the roll-top desk.  Mr. Teal's attention, however, was
attracted by the massive safe, and he stood for a time before
it, hands in the pockets of his waterproof, his lower jaw
functioning monotonously.
</p>

<p>
Then he turned to one of the men.
</p>

<p>
"Has this been touched, Topham?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Not a hand been laid on it?"
</p>

<p>
Topham appealed to his colleagues, and the reply was a
fairly confident negative.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, it's difficult to swear that nobody's touched it
without thinking."
</p>

<p>
Teal nodded.
</p>

<p>
From his waistcoat pocket he produced a powerful lens
in a chamois bag, polished it on his handkerchief, and
subjected the surface of the door to a prolonged scrutiny.
Secondly, he studied the lock, and then he called one of the
men over.
</p>

<p>
"Take a look at it," he advised.  "Now, you see the faint
scratches by the keyhole?  D'you notice any new ones?"
</p>

<p>
"Two or three," was the result after a short examination.
"There's also some marks inside the edges of the keyhole
itself.  They're all very new; in this weather the brass
would tarnish quickly, and these marks are perfectly
bright."
</p>

<p>
"Would a key be likely to leave those inside scratches?"
</p>

<p>
The man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not an expert, sir, but I should say not, unless the
original key had been lost and a carelessly made substitute
used."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Teal, and sank upon his knees as if
in prayer.
</p>

<p>
He made a number of deep obeisances before the huge
steel box, and then regained his feet with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Keep off this bit of carpet," he ordered.  "We shall want
an expert on this."
</p>

<p>
The expert was on the spot within fifteen minutes of
Teal's telephone summons, and he came to a decision in a
very short time.
</p>

<p>
"This is either Prester John's or Grantor's work," he
pronounced, and Teal was too hardened to the daily miracles
of the police records department to show any surprise at
the definiteness of his Holmesian piece of deduction.
</p>

<p>
A number of micro-photographs were taken, and the fine
specks of metallic dust which Teal had discovered on the
carpet in his supplicatory attitude were carefully brushed
up and placed in an envelope.  The safe was also tested for
finger-prints, the expert in that science going over it
minutely with his grey powder and camel's hair brush, but
nothing whatever rewarded his labours.
</p>

<p>
"The extraordinary thing," he said, "is that there's no
mark of any kind.  If Raegenssen had touched the safe at
all recently, he either wore gloves or wiped it with a rag
afterwards."
</p>

<p>
In an hour the plates had been developed and compared
with similar close-ups classified in the colossal card-index
system of the Records Office, and the unhesitating verdict
was phoned through to Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
The vote went to Prester John, and the somnolent detective
became a perplexed and irritated man, for the fact
upset every single one of his theories and dizzied him
completely out of his bearings.
</p>

<p>
After three thoughtful slabs of chewing-gum he rang up
Storm, obtained permission, and then got through to the
Yard and demanded the attendance of a third expert—a
gentleman who in the past years had earned a comfortable
income from his knowledge of safes until a false step and
a term of confinement at His Majesty's expense had exacted
from him due labour of hire already received, and
(unusually enough) instilled into the said gentleman an
enthusiasm for a more restful, if less remunerative and
spectacular, employment on the lee side of the Law.  On
occasion, however, the ex-yegg had opportunities for the
exercise of his craft without fear of retribution, and this
was one of those occasions.
</p>

<p>
"Open that money box," commanded Teal without preface,
and the expert, after a practised survey, grinned
superciliously.
</p>

<p>
"This is degradin' an honourable perfession," he
complained.  "A blind elepeptic palarytic could open this tin wiv
an 'air-pin an' a corkscrew.  I suppose," went on the
uncertain vocabularian, warming to his topic, "it ain't to be
dammagid?  Becos, if you ain't particulant, an' there 'appens
to be a sardine opener on the presimes——"
</p>

<p>
"Get on with it," said the detective testily, for he was
not feeling humorous at the moment.
</p>

<p>
The expert got to work with a pained air, first experimenting
with three skilfully twisted lengths of steel wire,
and then filing a key with the result of his investigations to
guide him.
</p>

<p>
At the end of half an hour:
</p>

<p>
"An' 'ere we are.  All chynge for Charing Cross an' the
Pink Elephant an' Castrol.  Pass dahn the car, please!  An'
I may say, Mr. Charman, that a softer crib 'as yet to be
builded.  Why, if the game 'ad bin so elemtenary in my days,
when I was an exterp at the skience, I'd've bin a blinkin'
millionanthropist by now, I would.  Drivin' abaht Myfair
in a calabriot, wiv all the flatties touchin' their 'ats to me an'
'opin' I'd put a monkey in their Christmas Box.  That's the
narks all over.  One lore for the rich an' another fer the
porous.  An' no gratootooies—'cept from those 'oo make
them big enough."  He regarded the confounded detective
in wonder.  "Well, well, Mr. Teal—wot's the matter?  Ain't
nothink there?  Well, wot did jer expect ter find?  A
leopotamosceraffe or a box o' pink pills?  This ain't Masculine's,
yer know.  No conjuratin' in this gallery."
</p>

<p>
"Shut up, Nosey," said Teal rudely.  "You can leg it
now—we shan't want you any more.  Oh, leave that key
behind you.  I want to shut this thing up again when I've
finished."
</p>

<p>
When the "exterp" had taken his departure Teal sat back
on the desk and stared at the open safe.  Empty, vacuously
empty, it stared back at him—one of the most annoying
voids he had ever seen.  The rows of steel shelves were bare.
The only souvenir that Prester John had left behind him
was the cardboard replica of the Triangle badge which Teal
had managed to conceal from the roving eye of the ex-yegg.
</p>

<p>
Teal went back to the outer office and interrupted
Mattock from the work of balancing a bulky ledger.
</p>

<p>
"When were you last here?" demanded the detective.
</p>

<p>
"Yesterday," said Mattock, without looking up.
</p>

<p>
"Did you go into that inner office?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"What time was this?"
</p>

<p>
"About eleven-thirty."
</p>

<p>
"P.m.?" asked Teal sleepily.
</p>

<p>
Mattock raised his eyes with a tired expression.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, are you still here?" he sighed.
</p>

<p>
"Pip emma?" repeated Teal.
</p>

<p>
Mattock closed the ledger and pushed back his chair.  His
face was a picture of long-suffering tolerance.
</p>

<p>
"Is this a new kind of round game?" he inquired politely.
"Because, if so, can't you get a detective or some
other imbecile to play with you?"
</p>

<p>
"No—you'll do.  Is Prester John a friend of yours?"
</p>

<p>
"I seem to have read about him.  Did he write a book or
something?"
</p>

<p>
Teal played his penultimate card.
</p>

<p>
He leaned over the desk and addressed Mattock in a
confidential undertone.
</p>

<p>
"Listen here," he said.  "Joan's in the Triangle—you
know that, don't you?  And you're fond of a Joan.  So am
I.  A nice kid.  It's only circumstances make a crook of her.
I'd hate to see her follow the rest of the Triangle into stir,
and she will, in time, if one of you hasn't a pull somewhere.
You're independent now, but I guess there's a day coming
when you'll be glad of a friend or two on the Embankment.".
</p>

<p>
Mattock studied his finger-nails.
</p>

<p>
"When we sink as low as that," he said carefully, "I'll
let you know."
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal straightened himself and shrugged.  He
walked over to the door of the inner office and called one of
his men, and together they returned to the clerk.
</p>

<p>
"Arrest that man," said Teal, and Mattock rose to his
feet with a charming smile.
</p>

<p>
"The charge?" he asked pleasantly.
</p>

<p>
"Burglary and assault at the house of Oscar Raegenssen
on the fourteenth instant.  Accessory before and after the
fact in the burglary committed in this office last night.
Suspected of concealing knowledge of the whereabouts of
Oscar Raegenssen, who is wanted on a warrant issued last
night.  I warn you that anything you say may be taken down
and used as evidence against you."
</p>

<p>
Mattock bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks for being so lucid.  But you've got the last part
of it wrong, you know.  The correct formula is, <i>used as
evidence at your trial</i>."
</p>

<p>
"As evidence at your trial," Teal corrected himself testily.
"Take him away."
</p>

<p>
"One moment."  Mattock stopped him.  "The third charge
falls to the ground, naturally.  You've only asked me about
Raegenssen's past movements—not about his present
whereabouts."
</p>

<p>
"That'll keep," said Teal viciously.  "Try it on the jury."
</p>

<p>
He was feeling rather fed up with Mattock's imperturbable
assurance.
</p>

<p>
They took Mattock to Headquarters, and the formal
charge was made.  The same mocking tolerance permeated
the man's demeanour when the usual questions were asked.
</p>

<p>
"Name?"
</p>

<p>
"James Norman Mattock."
</p>

<p>
"Age?"
</p>

<p>
"Fifty-seven years, eight months, one week, four days"—he
looked at his watch—"eleven hours and about forty
minutes."
</p>

<p>
"Address?"
</p>

<p>
"I decline to answer that question."
</p>

<p>
His tone encouraged no insistence on the inquiry, and
they let it go at that.
</p>

<p>
They were taking him to his cell when he called Inspector
Teal.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I'll have to stop behind bars for a bit to satisfy
your vanity," he said, "but I don't want it to be too long.
So you might get hold of Captain Arden when you have
the chance, and ask him if he'll see me."
</p>

<p>
"I'll find out how his temper is this morning," Teal
promised him, and Mattock passed on with a courteous word of
thanks.
</p>

<p>
In Storm's room, however, the detective found something
else to occupy his mind, and it temporarily eclipsed his
concern as to the fate of James Norman Mattock.
</p>

<p>
"I've got hold of a copy of the deed of sale of that
sawmill," Kit said.  "It's signed by Raegenssen, more or less,
but there's something wrong with the signature—it doesn't
agree with the writing on the papers they brought in from
his office.  Men with two handwritings make me take notice!"
</p>

<p>
Teal looked at the parchment, and particularly at the date.
</p>

<p>
"Two months ago.  That's about when the reformation
set in," he observed.
</p>

<p>
In the City and Continental office, Joe Blaythwayt was
inclined to be taciturn about his client's business until the
importance of his coöperation was pointed out to him, and
duly signed authorisation produced.
</p>

<p>
"No, that's not his ordinary signature," he said as soon
as he saw the conveyance.  "I'll get you some genuine
specimens."
</p>

<p>
He returned almost immediately with a bundle of cancelled
cheques, and these Storm compared with the signature
of the deed.  The two were totally dissimilar.  Whereas
the writing on the parchment was small and neat, all the
cheques were signed in a thick, sprawling hand.
</p>

<p>
The latest cheque attracted his attention for another reason.
</p>

<p>
"That's a lot of money to draw in cash," he remarked.
"How did he take it?"
</p>

<p>
"Fivers.  It wasn't the first time—I think you'll find two
others made out for large sums, though that one is easy
the largest he's ever put through."
</p>

<p>
Teal nodded.
</p>

<p>
"One way he is Triangular, the other way he isn't," he
said peevishly.  "That man's the two horns of a fat dilemma,
all right.  That sawmill wasn't really his, then!"
</p>

<p>
Storm rang up the other party to the sale, and found him
after some trouble—the managing director of a firm of
paper manufacturers with an office close by.  Having found
that the man was disengaged, Teal and he went round and
interviewed him.
</p>

<p>
The result was not satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
"I remember the transaction distinctly; I should have
remembered it, anyway, even if it hadn't been so recent,
because of the way payment was made."
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Teal perfunctorily, for the trial did not
seem to him to be leading anywhere.
</p>

<p>
"In notes of four different countries," was the reply.
"All denominations, big and small.  United States dollars,
the new Reichmarks, Spanish pesetas, and Italian lire.  I
didn't want to take them because of the Exchange
risk—something considerable in a sum as long as this one—but
he promptly added a five per cent. allowance to cover that."
</p>

<p>
"That must have cost him something."
</p>

<p>
The director nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Next, I was afraid of forgeries, but there again he met
me.  He went round with me to the bank and was present
while the notes were examined and passed."
</p>

<p>
Teal, interested, suspended chewing for a moment while
he put a question.
</p>

<p>
"Hard to describe," said the director.  "Nothing noticeable
about him, except his height.  Past middle age, I should
say.  Grey hair, eyes light blue, lined face, walked like a
much younger man.  Very well built, small iron-grey
moustache——"
</p>

<p>
"Beard?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Any kind of accent?"
</p>

<p>
"None at all.  He spoke English perfectly.  I'd take my
oath he was an Englishman."
</p>

<p>
"Raegenssen himself without face fungus!" exclaimed
Teal.  "I always thought that accent of his was a fake—it
sounded too much like the cheap revue idea of a Dutchman.
It was Raegenssen."
</p>

<p>
"Or Mattock cleverly padded," added the sceptical Kit.
"If you were going to do a deal in my name wouldn't you
try to make up to look like me in a general description?"
</p>

<p>
The mention of Mattock recalled to Teal his prisoner's
request, and he would have mentioned it as they returned
to the Yard, but Storm was already off on another tack.
</p>

<p>
"You remember Miss Hawthorne told me over the phone
she'd recognised someone in that getaway?  Well, she won't
pass the glad news on unless I promise she's to have a part
in the play.  Rat all women!"
</p>

<p>
"Arrest her as an accessory," suggested Teal sardonically.
</p>

<p>
"I'd be happier if she was inside!  <i>Kill H</i>....  Teal, if
you go down and break the neck of that constable who fell
over himself last night I'll guarantee to rescue you from
the gallows!  He's put everything back by weeks.  By the
way, did that ad. go in the <i>Era</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," said Teal.  "I put it over on Birdie all
right.  Mattock said I was a great actor," he added
reminiscently, and recollected his promise.
</p>

<p>
Teal waited in the charge room while Storm paid a visit to
the clerk's cell, and picked up a newspaper to while away
the time.
</p>

<p>
In those days the Press was so full of the Triangle that
most other information was crowded away into obscure
paragraphs in small type which few people ever read.  Teal,
having a single-track mind, rarely had time to assimilate any
news which did not bear directly on the case in hand, and
politics concerned him not at all.
</p>

<p>
But he already knew the Triangle news by heart, and
the second manifesto was by then as familiar to him as his
own face.  Consequently, he broke his usual habits and cast
an eye over the other happenings of the world.  And one
section fairly leapt to his eye.

<p class="t3">
  DEATH OF A GREAT SCIENTIST<br>
  DEPORTED AUSTRIAN CHEMIST COMMITS SUICIDE<br>
  UNCOMPLETED WORK<br>
</p>

<p class="t3">
  (<i>Daily Mercury Special Correspondent</i>)<br>
</p>

<p class="letter">
VIENNA, Tuesday, June 3rd.
</p>

<p class="letter">
A drama of real life is locked up in the news of the death of
the Austrian scientist, Carl Schewesen, who was deported
from England some years ago.  Schewesen's clothes were found
on the banks of the Danube, together with a note explaining
that he was taking what seemed to him to be the only way out
of a hopeless existence.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Schewesen was known to have been making researches
into the possibility of stabilising Nitrogen Trichloride (NCl<sub>3</sub>),
the most powerful explosive known to science, but, as far as
contemporary methods of preparation have progressed, entirely
without practical use, since even particles of dust settling
upon it from the atmosphere are sufficient to detonate it.
Schewesen had announced a few days before his death that
his experiments promised an epoch-making success.  He has
left no notes behind, however, and it is to be feared that his
knowledge has died with him.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Teal read the paragraph a second time, for this premature
obituary notice did not appeal to his sense of humour.
He was quite certain that Carl Schewesen was alive
and in London, and, Storm returning with Mattock at
that moment, he pointed to the column and vented his
surmise.
</p>

<p>
Storm read it through, and looked grave.
</p>

<p>
"NCl<sub>3</sub>," he murmured.  "That sounds like more fun!"
</p>

<p>
"Is it very powerful?" asked Teal, and Storm smiled.
</p>

<p>
"If a small saltspoonful went off between us now, they'd
be able to bury us in matchboxes!" he said.
</p>

<p>
It was then that Teal noticed the presence of Mattock,
and turned to scowl at the man.  Mattock had been looking
over the detective's shoulder unobserved, and his smile
showed that he had heard the conversation.
</p>

<p>
"I know all about Carl," Mattock said.  "But the problem
ought to amuse the flatties for some time.  Flatties, I think,
was the term Nosey used?"
</p>

<p>
Teal was struck by the change in the man's manner since
he had met him in Walton Street Police Station.  Then,
Mattock had had the truculence which comes of an inferiority
complex; but that had now dispersed as though it had never
existed.  In spite of the shabbiness of his clothes and the
ugly lines which prison had cut in his face, he bore himself
with a calm confidence that annoyed Teal.  It annoyed him
because he could not understand it.  It was so out of keeping
with the part of the lag under supervision.  Truculence
was regular, and cringing was also in order, though less
common.  So, too, was friendliness.  But superiority—no.
</p>

<p>
"You look pleased with yourself," said Teal glutinously,
falling back into his <i>rôle</i> of <i>ennui</i> personified.
</p>

<p>
"So I feel," agreed Mattock.  "Captain Arden has very
kindly permitted me to be released."  He glanced at his wrist.
"It's just lunch time.  Thank the Lord I'm spared the
culinary abortions you serve to persons in custody."
</p>

<p>
Teal's jaw dropped.
</p>

<p>
"Is that true?" he asked, and Storm nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, Inspector," he said officially.  "I don't think
any of the charges against this man will stand.  You will,
however, keep him under observation."
</p>

<p>
"I will!" asserted Teal grimly.
</p>

<p>
Mattock raised his hat and sauntered to the door with a
smile.  There, he paused.
</p>

<p>
"I should keep an eye on Uncle Joe, too," was his
parting shot.
</p>

<p>
Teal stared sombrely at the door through which the man
had passed.  He shook his head sorrowfully.
</p>

<p>
"And there, by the Grace of the Devil," he muttered,
"goes a man who knows far, far more about the Triangle
than I shall ever find out."
</p>

<p>
"I've also cancelled the warrant that's out against
Raegenssen," Storm said.  "I don't think any charge will
stand against him, either, yet.  It's easy to prove that the
signature to that deed isn't his, and there's no chance of
tracing those foreign bills.  You won't even get him by
identification—nor will you get Mattock, for the matter of
that.  Neither of 'em fit exactly."
</p>

<p>
He was tapping a cigarette on his case when the telephone
rang, and he was told that the call was for him.  When he
came back, the light of war was in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Now we shall see some more battle, murder and sudden
death!" he said.  "That was to say Mecklen's better.
I'm going to get him to court to-morrow, if there's a whole
army of Triangles in the way!  And then we'll see if he'll
squeak."
</p>

<p>
"He isn't the Triangle, anyway," said Teal gloomily.
"Is it Mattock?"
</p>

<p>
Storm did not answer.
</p>

<p>
"Or is it Uncle Joe?"
</p>

<p>
Storm was intent upon the feat of throwing his cigarette
high in the air and catching it between his lips—a piece of
amateur juggling which he performed with skill.
</p>

<p>
"Then it must be Raegenssen," Teal said dreamily.
</p>

<p>
"Keep on guessing," Storm encouraged.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal shook his head and nipped the end from a rank
cigar.
</p>

<p>
"You're so close, you'd make an oyster look like a
yawning whale," he protested in despair.  "Now, why let
Mattock out?  I'll bet that man knows all the things we want
to know about Alphas and Apexes."
</p>

<p>
"Speak for yourself," murmured Storm, concluding his
exhibition of sleight-of-hand by throwing his cigarette
over his shoulder from the back and trapping it faultlessly.
</p>

<p>
Teal did not applaud.
</p>

<p>
"He must have had something exciting to tell you," he
pondered aloud.  "Was it absolutely necessary to release
him?"
</p>

<p>
Storm, who was striking a match, watched it flare, and
then looked up with his quick smile.
</p>

<p>
"Oh—sure!" he drawled.  "He's going to kill Raegenssen!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV
<br><br>
ONCE A GENTLEMAN
</h3>

<p>
Storm being an unconventional young man, it was not to
be expected that the private report on the Battle of Billingsgate
which he sent to Sir John Marker would be strictly in
accord with conventional ideas on the correct composition
of such documents.  Kit Arden had no manner of use for
formulas; jargon made him feel ill; in the presence of the
bugaboo of official phraseology he positively writhed.  He
banged out his points with crisp simplicity, and framed
them in sentences like bullets.
</p>

<p>
The letter is worth quoting <i>in extenso</i>, for reasons which
will be apparent at sight.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
When once the door of the sawmill had been opened, and
the janitor removed without noise, the fate of the Alpha Triangle
hung by a hair.  In spite of the telephone call which told
the men in the building that their heavily armoured bag had
lost its cat, they could not forecast the minute in which the
information so gained would be acted upon.  The future of the
organisation was suspended by that slender thread; our hope
of being in amongst them, raising Hell, before they could collect
their wits.  You already know how that thread was snapped.
</p>

<p class="letter">
Whatever a man's genius, he cannot dream of terrorising a
city—as the Apex intends to do—without a large number of
assistants.  With his young army of helpers locked away, he
would have been crippled—perhaps irretrievably.
</p>

<p class="letter">
However, we failed—so that's that.  Anyway, all we made
was an attempt to maim, when our object is to kill.
</p>

<p class="letter">
One or two details stand over.
</p>

<p class="letter">
(1) Besides myself, two others got into the sawmill.  One
was Miss Hawthorne, secretary to the late Lord Hannassay,
who went simply in search of adventure.  The second was
Joseph Blaythwayt, manager of the City and Continental
Bank, Lombard Street, who in his spare time aspires to
sleuthship.  He is a friend of Inspector Teal, from whom he had
heard unpublished facts about the Triangle which (on his own
account) fired him with thoughts of honour and glory as an
amateur Sherlock.  He is also one of the lives threatened by
the Triangle, which fact does not perturb him unduly.
</p>

<p class="letter">
(2) In my opinion, the telephone call which followed our
departure came by chance, and was not based on knowledge
of any of our plans.
</p>

<p class="letter">
(3) Raegenssen's office was burgled last night, and the safe
opened, but I don't know if the men found anything.  A lot of
attention has centred round Raegenssen lately, so I expect his
obituary notice is only a matter of days.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The Billingsgate raid having failed, I am basing my next
move on the Era advertisement.  It will, of course, be risky; but
if anything goes wrong you will know what to do.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I can only guess how the Triangle will continue its campaign.
I probably have a better appreciation of that colossal
mind than anybody else; but if I gave you a logical prophecy,
even you might begin to regard me as an imaginative alarmist.
The solid <i>fact</i>, which you and everyone else has got to get
hold of, is that for the time being all the odds are on the
Triangle.  They have all the advantage of surprise.  Just now, the
police aren't prepared.  Violent crime isn't familiar to them yet.
They can't quite adjust themselves to it—it'll catch them napping,
and they'll take time to get busy.  There's a genius at the
top of the Triangle—or a lunatic, whichever you care to call
him—and the police are neither geniuses nor lunatics.  They're
just plain ornery men dealing with plain ornery crooks, with
all the odds on the crook.  Crooks catch themselves and each
other, but there'll be no nosing the Triangle.  It can pay too
well, and the little twisters follow the big money.  Gangs in the
past have gone just because discontented members shopped
them.  There will be no discontented members of the Triangle—why,
their chief can even pull them out of the hands of the
police!  The rescue of the Billingsgate prisoners will add
tremendously to the prestige of the Apex.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I promised you the head of the Apex on a Triangle in a
fortnight, and that fortnight still has some time to run.
</p>

<p class="letter">
The brain of the Apex moves in such great leaps that nothing
less than genius could anticipate it from pinnacle to pinnacle.
Against that there is only one card to play—fear.  Even
genius has nerves.  Even genius can be made to worry about its
neck.
</p>

<p class="letter">
I shall win.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The removal of Lew Mecklen from St. George's Hospital
to Marlborough Street Police Court was not advertised,
but Storm did not doubt that the Intelligence Bureau
of the Triangle had its own sources of information.  He had
asked for, and secured, a special escort from Wellington
Barracks, and they were served out with ball ammunition.
It was a wise precaution, for the soldier, being a lethal
machine, is less chary of using firearms than the London
constable, who is a civil institution into whose routine the more
effective forms of violence rarely enter.  Apparently the
Triangle admitted that Mecklen was well guarded, for no
attempt was made on the armoured car in which the gunman
rode with platoons of scarlet-coated men marching in
front and behind.
</p>

<p>
Lew was taken into the tiny court-room, and a stream of
detectives followed him and filled the rest of the space.
Outside, uniformed men blocked the tiled hall, and the
military escort stood at ease in the road.
</p>

<p>
The proceedings were brief, for attempted murder offers
no option of summary jurisdiction.  Mecklen pleaded not
guilty and declined to instruct a solicitor.  Evidence of arrest
was taken, to which the prisoner paid little attention.  The
verbal proceedings seemed not to interest him, but he studied
his surroundings curiously.  He did not cross-examine, and
made no statement, and the whole business took no more
than ten minutes.
</p>

<p>
"Without a hitch," remarked Storm, in grim reminiscence
of the formal Press account of executions—"thanks
to the Army!"
</p>

<p>
Mecklen was committed for trial, and, whilst the necessary
papers were being made out and signed, he was taken
to a cell in the adjoining police station.  It was when they
removed him and told him that he would be taken immediately
to Brixton Prison that he showed his first sign of
uneasiness.  He asked if a message had come for him, and,
when informed that none had arrived up to that time, he
asked to be allowed to see a newspaper.  On Storm's authority,
the request was refused, and Mecklen was handcuffed
and led out between a double rank of policemen.  Teal went
in front and Storm brought up the rear, and as the cortège
came into view of the street Teal halted so suddenly that
Storm trod on the prisoner's heels.
</p>

<p>
Pushing his way to the front, Arden found the detective
staring up and down the street with a ludicrously blank
expression on his sanguine countenance.  Storm looked also,
and his lean face hardened.  There was a cab rank in the
road, and he went over at once and asked a question of one
of the drivers.
</p>

<p>
"About arf an hour ago," said the man.  "Just after the
man'd bin taken in.  A cop comes out an 'ands a note to the
orf'cer, an' walks away, an' then the orf'cer shouts <i>'Shun!</i>
an' off they goes."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see the constable's face?" asked Storm, and
the chauffeur scratched his head.
</p>

<p>
"S'pose I must 'ave, but I didn't take much stock of it.
You don't inspect every copper's dial wot yer sees—you'd
get 'eart failure!  Just looked an ord'nary pleeceman to me.
'Ulkin' great feller, oldish, walked as if 'e owned the
earth—like they all do."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Storm bitterly, and returned to the
waiting group on the station steps.
</p>

<p>
By that time the escort would be back in barracks.  In the
first instance, there had been more than enough red tape,
and no little grumbling in high places about troops being
called upon to do the work of the police.  A fresh escort
would not be procured without considerable delay, and
perhaps not even then.  And yet a military guard Storm was
determined to have.  As it turned out later, he had made a
grave mistake in jumping to the conclusion that the
dismissal of the soldiery by means of a forged message was
simply a ruse to make him send Mecklen to the prison in the
ordinary van and under police escort only.  Bearing in mind
the Tower Hill affair, this was the explanation he had
reached, and it made him doubly set on attempting no such
hazard.  He had Mecklen taken back to his cell, and ordered
a special watch to be mounted over him.  Then he rang up
the C.O. at the barracks, and found that the two platoons
had just returned.
</p>

<p>
"You might find out if the officer kept my note," he said,
and waited until the requisite information was forthcoming.
"He has? ... I'm sending a constable round for it now;
he'll give his number, which is C2447....  Oh, no, nothing
whatever, except that the note happens to be a fake! ... That
so?  Well, you're not half so sorry as I am."
</p>

<p>
He listened for a moment, and then replaced the receiver
with great care.
</p>

<p>
"Started to quote me: <i>If you want a thing done well,</i>"
he explained.  "On the whole, the observation's appropriate,
but not the way he meant."
</p>

<p>
Teal was looking glum.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it," he confessed.  "And yet, on the face of
it, Lew's almost as safe here as he'd have been in Brixton.
But this Triangle's a shade too snappy for Claud
Eustace—they think of things the ordinary crook'd laugh at, and
they do 'em, and so far they've got away with them every
darned time by sheer nerve."
</p>

<p>
"There's a special guard," Storm said, "and you can
spend the night here yourself if you like.  I'll see if I can
see Marker and get a special order for another parade
to-morrow.  We can't do any more.  Either the Triangle's thinking
of raiding the station, or they're planning to hold up the
prison van, and I think the first is the least likely to
succeed."
</p>

<p>
Teal shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"I agree; but it doesn't make me happy.  Triangles have
three corners, so I guess they might manage to have a prick
waiting in two places," he said prophetically.
</p>

<p>
Down at the Yard, however, a slight ray of hope awaited
them, for the call put out the previous day for Prester John
had been successful, and the burglar was even then being
detained in Cannon Row pending audience.
</p>

<p>
The man who had made the arrest foreshadowed the result
of the interview in his account.
</p>

<p>
"I took John in a bar in Camden Tower, where he often
goes.  He didn't deny the charge, and said he was coming
along to see Captain Arden to-day, anyhow."
</p>

<p>
"He's got his wish, then," said Teal.  "Send him up."
</p>

<p>
The facetious parent who, while replete with beer, had
bestowed upon Mr. John the prænomen of Prester must
have been gifted with second sight.  The celebrated infringer
of the laws of property resembled nothing so much as an
elderly parson.  He was lank and lofty, sallow-complexioned
and blue of chin.  He affected clothes of clerical hue, wore a
high Gladstonian collar and a black bow tie, and generally
gave the impression of sanctimoniousness incarnate.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, brethren," he said politely.  "I heard
that my Lords had need of men, and I came."
</p>

<p>
It was his invariable greeting when summoned before
the police to account for his lapses, and he accompanied it
with an equally automatic gesture, holding his elbows in to
his sides, bringing his forearms horizontal, and spreading
out his flat palms in the same plane, a mannerism which the
irreverent Inspector Teal described as "John's lo-and-behold
mitt-flap."
</p>

<p>
"Acoustics excellent!" commented Storm.  "I hear you
visited Mr. Raegenssen last night."
</p>

<p>
"On business," nodded Prester John.
</p>

<p>
"And was he pleased to see you?" asked Teal.
</p>

<p>
"He was—er—unfortunately unable to attend."
</p>

<p>
Storm passed his cigarette case to the pious one and,
when John declined, lighted a cigarette himself.
</p>

<p>
"How much was Mattock paying you?" he asked, waving
his match in the air to extinguish it.
</p>

<p>
"Mattock?"
</p>

<p>
"Raegenssen's clerk.  He put you on to the job, didn't
he?"
</p>

<p>
"Not that I know of—although, of course, since the name
is unfamiliar to me, he may have been the man.  May I sit
down?  It assists the train of thought."
</p>

<p>
Permission being granted, the man seated himself with
a sigh and hitched up his trousers fastidiously.  Leaning
back, he fixed his eyes on the ceiling and pressed the tips
of his fingers together like a pedantic schoolmaster, and
after a dramatic pause he deigned to continue.
</p>

<p>
"The circumstances are—to say the least of it—curious,"
he said.  "To commence, then: I am, as you probably know
by now, a member of the society called the Alpha Triangle.
You have heard of it, of course?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Teal, <i>sotto voce</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Not, you understand, that I associate myself in any way
with the outrages which they propose to commit," John
explained hastily.  "No.  I am simply a wage slave—an
employee—an hireling.  And, in passing, the hire is worthy of
the hireling.  My employers pay me a salary, which is very
comfortable—thank you—and in return I undertake to deal
with such refractory locks and so forth as they wish to
penetrate.  So far I have had little to do, although I was
given to understand that there would be an important piece
of work for me in the near future.  The Bank of England, I
think Surcon said—Surcon is the name by which the Apex
is known to his men.  An assumed name, of course, but
we are not encouraged to discover his real one.  There was a
man named Rodriguez—a Portuguese—who said he was
going to find out the real name and put the black—I believe
that is the correct slang, Mr. Teal?—and—er—where had
I got to?  Oh, yes, put the black on.  Polite people call it
demanding money with menaces.  Rodriguez died the other
day.  Enteric, you know.  I'm sure of that, because I was
able to take a swab from the hypodermic syringe Mr. Surcon
used when he treated Rodriguez to a shot of morphine.
Surcon says he qualified as a doctor.  So did I.  In my leisure
moments, I still dabble in bacteriology, and <i>bacilli typhosi</i>
are easily recognised under the microscope by the trained
observer.  So—er—one is not encouraged to be inquisitive,
is one?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite," murmured Storm.
</p>

<p>
Inspector Teal cleared his throat noisily, fumbled aimlessly
in his pockets, and came across a battered cigar.  He
nipped the end from it, and sought for matches.  Instead, he
found a virgin packet of spearmint, and abandoned fumigation
in favour of mastication.  Then, having returned the
weary weed to his pocket and posted a wafer of chicle in his
mouth, he struck a match and absently wondered why there
wasn't anything to light.
</p>

<p>
Which seems to indicate a certain perturbation.
</p>

<p>
It does.  Mr. Teal was familiar with the vanity of criminals,
their affectations and their powers of plausible invention,
but the yarn of Prester John was something which
failed to enter the borders of his experience.  The germ of
truth in it stuck out like the Eiffel Tower: he had always
known that Prester John had drifted to burglary, not from
Borstal, but from Balliol, solely because of the moral kink
in his nature.  But the lying of criminals—which
psychologists will tell you is "pathological," whatever that may
mean—is expressly designed for the covering up of their
defects and defections—not the revelation of the same.
Wherefore Prester John became an interesting specimen.
</p>

<p>
A fact which seemed to have entered the mind of that
oleaginous man, for he allowed an appreciable time to elapse
before he resumed his confession—time during which the
theatrical atmosphere piled up hand over fist.
</p>

<p>
"Well—to return," he went on at last.  "Last night I
received a telephone call in the name of the Apex,
instructing me to proceed with all speed to Scandinavia House,
Cockspur Street.  My lord had need of me, so I went."  Interval
for the lo-and-behold mitt-flap.  "Entering the office
to which I had been directed to proceed, I found seated at a
desk a masked man—that sounds a bit thick to you, I
suppose, Mr. Teal, but you've got to take my word for it.
Er—a masked man, as I said.  Most extraordinary."
</p>

<p>
He had a trick of affecting to have lost the thread of
his discourse, and finding his place with an exaggerated
effort of concentration.
</p>

<p>
"This man—masked, as I told you—er—where was
I?  Oh, yes; this man explained to me that in his <i>rôle</i> of Ezra
Surcon—did I tell you that the Apex called himself Ezra
Surcon?"
</p>

<p>
"You did," assented Teal patiently.  "He explained?"
</p>

<p>
"That he was, of course, disguised when he appeared
before us, and he had not had time to assume his disguise
that night.  Therefore, with a solicitude for my own safety
which, I may say, touched me to the heart—therefore, he
had donned a mask.  And that was that.  He indicated a
safe, and invited me to open it.  Which, reasonably enough—you
understand—I did.  And, when I got in"—lo-and-behold—"the
cupboard was bare!"
</p>

<p>
Storm tapped the ash from his cigarette.  The revelation
affected him less than it did Inspector Teal; for he had
already deducted much of what he now heard, and the
criminal's story came as little more than a confirmation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mother Hubbard?" he prompted.
</p>

<p>
"And that was all," Prester John concluded with an eloquent
wave of his hand.  "Shall I ask you to picture the
scene?  My masked friend, shaking with baffled rage—quite
upset, you know.  Some people take things to heart so.  It's
a thing I—er—as I was saying, shaking with baffled rage;
myself, calm and serene, rather like a turf accountant's clerk
as the horses pass the post, knowing that whoever may have
lost money his own wages are secure.…  There's an
extraordinary attraction for me in gambling—I've always
wanted——"  He caught a murderous gleam in Inspector
Teal's eye, and tactfully returned to the point.  "So that was
that.  Shall I endeavour to picture for you the scene—to—to
delineate, so to speak, the situation?  Shall I——"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Teal with determination.  "What happened
after the tableau?"
</p>

<p>
John shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"What would you?  I went.  My Lord's manner did not
give me the assurance which every gentleman requires before
he continues to inflict his company on a comrade, that
he is welcome.  You follow?  The moment did not appear
propitious for bringing up such sordid topics as my own
remuneration.  I folded up my wallet and silently stole
away."
</p>

<p>
He uncrossed his legs as though, his mission accomplished,
he was about to repeat that man[oe]uvre, but Teal's
curiosity was no more than whetted.
</p>

<p>
"Did you see any Triangles that night?"
</p>

<p>
"Er—no."
</p>

<p>
"Not this?" persisted Teal, and produced from his wallet
the cardboard insigne he had found in the safe.
</p>

<p>
Prester John examined it with interest, but he shook his
head as he handed it back.
</p>

<p>
"This is one of the badges which are issued to the inferior
members—the rank and file, so to speak," he said.  "The
higher members have tokens of silver and enamel.  My
own—er—have you finished with it yet, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
The question was ignored.  Teal and Storm were busy
with their own thoughts, and both these ran in the same
channel.  Storm, who was watching the methods of the two
men dispassionately, allowed the detective to give tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Why have you spun us this yarn?"
</p>

<p>
"Why?  I—er—thought it might possibly be of some
assistance," said John deprecatingly.  "As a matter of fact,
I am giving up my illegal activities altogether, and resigning
from the Triangle.  I heard this morning that some obscure
relative had died and left me money—nothing great,
you understand, but sufficient at least to enable me to inhabit
once more those haunts of culture and respectability after
which my soul hankers."
</p>

<p>
Teal grunted non-committally and made a mental memorandum
to verify this glad news.  Prester John read the
disbelief on the round red face, and smiled faintly.
</p>

<p>
"That happens to be true," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Then can you help us to locate any other members—silver
badge size members, I mean—or any boltholes?"
</p>

<p>
John made a negative gesture regretfully.
</p>

<p>
"I wish I could," he said.  "Unfortunately, I was never
taken to any rendezvous but the one at Billingsgate, of
which you already know.  As for members, I have
never—er—been in the habit of associating with gentlemen in the
same—er—line of business as myself.  Now that I am
meditating a return to the straight and narrow path, my chief
ambition is to—er—rehabilitate myself with the police,
bearing no malice for the many tussles we have had in the
past.  But my acquaintances are unhappily so useless for
your purpose."
</p>

<p>
Teal knew that this was the truth, for one of Prester
John's many peculiarities was that he never mixed with
other criminals, planned and executed all his coups
single-handed, and disposed of the proceeds through channels
unknown to the underworld.
</p>

<p>
"There's no clue you could give us about the masked
man?" said Storm.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing.  In fiction, a scar—a limp—a missing button.
In real life, nothing.  Tall, and I should think well-built; but
since he wore an overcoat I shall not take the risk
of—er—perjuring myself on that point."
</p>

<p>
Storm himself opened the door to the reforming burglar,
and, receiving an almost imperceptible signal, followed
the man out into the passage.
</p>

<p>
"All I've told you is blowed-in-the-glass," said Prester
John in a rapid undertone, his pose having dropped from
him like a cloak.  "I am really going straight, and I know no
more than I've told you.  Except this.  I know how it is
between you and Miss Hawthorne—why, if a split sneezes it's
known all over the underworld in half an hour.  The order
went out that she's got to go, and Lew's been told off to do
it.  He's going to escape to-night—I suppose you knew that?
But that isn't Lew's way."  He looked at Storm steadily.
"The difference between Lew and me is that I was once a
gentleman—whatever that may mean.  But I was.  Lew
never will be.  His mind is so ... vulgar.  Take a stable
tip."
</p>

<p>
He held out his hand a little hesitatingly, and smiled
when Storm took it.
</p>

<p>
"Thanks," said Storm.  "But why couldn't you say that
in front of Teal?"
</p>

<p>
"My—er—dear sir, one must make good exits—intriguing
curtains."  He swung his stick, and once more his face
was sanctimonious and his voice treacly.  "The worthy
Inspector Teal has, in his blundering fashion, crossed swords
with me on many memorable occasions.  Once, he even
succeeded in obtaining my—er—incarceration for a period of
three years—-the only time I have ever been inside.
Painstaking—slow and sure—but not brilliant.  I have taken a
number of years convincing him that the Church was my
proper <i>métier</i>.  His mind is not elastic.  I feared that if
I—er—removed the mask of the musical comedy parson the
shock, you know—terrible, terrible, terrible—all one's
ideas dislocated—and so forth.  You appreciate my point?"
he pleaded, and there was a peep of laughter in Storm's
grey eyes as he watched the lank figure pass mincingly
down the stone corridor.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI
<br><br>
SENSATION OUT OF COURT
</h3>

<p>
Storm returned to meet the lazily inquiring gaze of
Inspector Teal.  Teal was far too ponderous a man to be
swayed by the emotions of the thin-flanked herd, but it was
obvious that puzzlement was seething within his placid
bulk—the symptom was the exaggerated precision with
which his jaws chewed from side to side the plastic
sweetmeat of Mr. Wrigley—and Storm was privately amused.
</p>

<p>
"What was his secret?" demanded the detective with assumed
languor, when after some time the information had
not been volunteered.
</p>

<p>
"Oh—Prester John sent you his love," Storm replied
truthfully but uncertainly.  "He didn't dare give it you in
person!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal's recumbent mountainousness heaved with an
explosive grunt which registered unbelief.
</p>

<p>
They parted, for Storm had a luncheon engagement for
which he did not wish to be unpunctual.  He met Susan at
the portals of the Regal, and thought that he had rarely
seen her looking so beautiful.  Being gloriously ignorant of
the niceties of feminine apparel, he received from her dress
no other impression than that it suited her to perfection.  In
her smart costume of plain bisque, relieved only by the
daring splash of green where a flowing kerchief was knotted
loosely at the throat of her white silk undertunic, she was
piquantly beautiful.  The bright sunshine lit up her smiling
face, and its searching brilliance at once absolved her red
lips and the faint flush of health on her cheeks from all
accusation of artifice.
</p>

<p>
They made a striking couple.
</p>

<p>
Her loveliness was none of that pink-and-white fragility
to which a certain type of Frenchwoman aspires—prettiness
which is at one and the same glance irresistibly attractive
and yet so obviously unfitted for any locale but the
drawing-room and the Poiret gown.  She was essentially a
girl of the open spaces, with the lithe, free grace of carriage
and the delicate browning of a clear skin which come only
with a perfectly functioning body bred of, and to, the love
of plenty of exercise in the eye of the sun and in the breath
of the wind.  And Storm fitted her perfectly, being a man
good to look upon and finely built, and having a boyish
love of laughter always lurking in his steady eyes to
counteract the first impression of hardness you got from the
squareness of his jaw and the vigorous set of his mouth.
Outstanding at once by the lissom poise of his athletic
figure, with just that indefinable air of restraint about him
which is the infallible sign of a tremendously dynamic
vitality controlled and directed by a dominant will.
</p>

<p>
He had meant to talk to her gravely, warning her of the
dangers she was running, and pointing out the foolhardiness
of her last night's adventure.  She, for her part, had
made up her mind to laugh at his fears and complain of his
selfishness in keeping all the thrills for himself.  He had
meant to be firm: she had meant to be defiant.  Somehow,
neither programme produced according to schedule.
</p>

<p>
"Who was the man you recognized last night?" he asked
her point blank, and her resolutions crumbled so weakly
that she hated herself.
</p>

<p>
"The man we saw when we had that motor accident," she
answered meekly.  "Mattock, I think you called him."
</p>

<p>
Storm had known that, unless she was bluffing, it must
have been one of three men, and he annoyed her afresh by
the coolness with which he received the report.
</p>

<p>
"He's an enterprising man," he murmured, passing his
cigarette case across the table.  "One of these days there'll
be trouble for James—you wager the haberdashery on
uncle!"
</p>

<p>
"Aren't you interested?"
</p>

<p>
He raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Fairly!  I know nearly everything there is to be known
about Mattock.  At the moment, I'm betting in my mind
which'll die first—James Norman or Oscar Siegfried.  That
problem, however, is reserved strictly for office hours, and
this is my lunch interval.  What're you going to do about a
job now Papa Hannassay is with the majority?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't know that I need one," she said surprisingly.
"He's left me everything.  I heard from the solicitors this
morning."
</p>

<p>
Storm bit his lip.
</p>

<p>
"How much?"
</p>

<p>
The bluntness of his question made her stare at him.  She
found him unaccountably irritating that afternoon, and
had half a mind to snub him, but she decided that that might
be a failure.  He had an amused way of laughing at people
who stood on their dignity which was absolutely impossible
to deal with.
</p>

<p>
"Ten thousand odd—if you're so desperately interested,"
she said frigidly, and was speedily disconcerted.
</p>

<p>
His eyes danced with quiet mockery.
</p>

<p>
"I am.  Desperately interested," he assured her, and his
smile swept pettiness out of existence.  "Susan, don't be
small!  It's an important question, because I always
understood old Pop Hannassay was rich."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be irreverent," she said severely.  "<i>De mortuis</i>——"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nil nisi ludicrum</i>.  And how about the dead what die in
their sins?"
</p>

<p>
She opened her bag and handed him the letter.  He read
it through carefully, and then made a note of the address
of the solicitors.'
</p>

<p>
"Bylom, Craill and Bylom, Suffolk House, Lester Street,
Strand.  I'll see 'em this afternoon.  Ten thousand!
Jerusalem—a few years ago old Daddy—sorry, Susan!—Lord
Hannassay was worth about half a million.  You ought to
be rich, instead of the unreasonably proud heiress to a
paltry ten thousand!"
</p>

<p>
"How do you know all this?" she asked in wonder.
</p>

<p>
He was not disposed to enlighten her at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"There's damn little I don't know!" he boasted airily.
"The snag is, it's going to take me all my time to remove
just those little scraps of ignorance!"  He looked at her for
a moment, frowning thoughtfully, and then dropped a bolt
from the blue: "When can you be married?"
</p>

<p>
Her face went blank.
</p>

<p>
He disregarded all the time-honoured laws governing
the proper setting, manner and preliminaries for such
questions.  Twice he had made love to her—once, years ago, in
his breezy, inconsequent manner in the kitchen of the
Presidential Palace of Olvidada; for the second time, on that
night when he had driven her home from Raegenssen's.
And when he made love he was irresistible.  On the whole,
it was a proposition he should by rights have put forward
long ago; yet, now that he had put it forward, the suddenness
seemed alarming.  It caused a queer constriction about
her heart, and at the same time it brought to a head the
vague and formless anger that had troubled her all day.  He
had been almost insulting—he broke every accepted canon
for proposals.  In fact, he did not propose at all: he took her
for granted, and she was furious.
</p>

<p>
"Married to whom?" she asked with dangerous obtuseness.
</p>

<p>
"To me, of course."
</p>

<p>
The perplexed lift of her straight brows was perfectly
done.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand.  Why should I marry you?"
</p>

<p>
His eyes held hers, and at the back of that clear gaze she
saw a glint of comprehension and, coincidently, of
good-humoured reproof which was maddening.  Without batting
an eyelid, he suggested a sympathetic elder amusedly
tolerating the peevishness of a child.
</p>

<p>
"I really don't know," he said coolly.  "It occurred to me
you might like to.  Besides, you love me."
</p>

<p>
The man's audacity stunned her.  In her consternation it
was some time before she could find suitable words wherewith
to administer a stinging rebuke, and the effort was
not diminished by the knowledge that he had spoken
nothing but the truth.
</p>

<p>
"You flatter yourself," she said coldly, and he smiled.
</p>

<p>
"You flatter me," was his quick response.  "Now, for
the love of Mike don't boil over with rage—not till we've
finished eating, anyway.  Squabbling at meal times is so
horribly bad for the digestion!  You wouldn't like me to utter
a loud shriek and collapse on the floor, clasping my
diaphragm—a young man stricken down in his prime with
dyspepsia—would you?"
</p>

<p>
Her retort had simply glanced off the armour of his
confidence.  The edge of it had cut rather less ice than would
cover a sixpence.  He might have done no more than ask
her to go to the theatre with him, and agreed to wait
for an answer until she had consulted her engagement
book.  He was—Good Lord!  He was actually <i>humouring</i>
her!
</p>

<p>
"You're mistaken—you won't refuse ever to see me
again," he said, and, looking up, she saw that his eyes were
still upon her, and knew that he had read her thoughts.  And
then he switched from the subject with the abruptness of
the turning off of a tap: "How's Terry these days?  D'you
remember the X Esquire case?  Old Terry was in that,
though it never came out."
</p>

<p>
He continued blithely to recount the story in that staccato,
jerky way he had of speaking, and she had to listen in
spite of herself.
</p>

<p>
He could be a delightful <i>raconteur</i>—he had the happy
knack of coining spontaneous phrases which had the punch
of mule kicks.  Gradually, so gently that she never noticed
it, he thawed her out of her attitude of barely polite
attention.  Coffee was on the table before she realised how the
time was flying.  And, as she took the final cigarette he
offered her, light dawned.  Why had she been snappy?
Because she had had so little sleep the night before, and
tiredness had frayed her temper at the corners.  Why should
she vent her bad temper on him?  Because ... because
she'd read in the morning paper about the fight in Billingsgate
(and she'd never even asked him about it—what must
he think of her for that?) ... and she'd had her eyes
opened to the danger he was in—and because there was
some of <i>her</i>, something infinitely precious, going with him
into every peril he encountered....  <i>Because, for days, she
had longed for him to want to marry her....</i>
</p>

<p>
Understanding of herself came as a shock, but it did not
break her resolution—merely turned it in another direction.
He must have his lesson.  He must learn that methods which
battered a Board of Enquiry into submission (she had had
that anecdote retailed to her with great gusto by Bill
Kennedy himself when that genial Assistant Commissioner
dropped in for a nightcap with Terry) would not have the
same effect upon her.
</p>

<p>
She was still strong in this decision when they prepared
to leave, and, when he had paid the bill and was waiting
for his change, he had this fact demonstrated to him.
</p>

<p>
"For the last time but——"  He paused and studied the
end of his cigarette meditatively.  "But two—for the last
time but two, Susan, when will you marry me?"
</p>

<p>
"Never," she said, and hoped she sounded inflexible.
</p>

<p>
His eyes danced.  His optimistic egotism was unshakeable.
</p>

<p>
"Sure?"
</p>

<p>
"I've given you my answer," she said, straining to be
haughty in the face of that sunny smile.  "So please don't
ask me the other two times."
</p>

<p>
"I shan't forget," he promised ambiguously.  "But hear
me, Susan!  Unless you come and ask me to marry you
before midnight you'll sleep in a Vine Street cell, probably!"
</p>

<p>
She stared.
</p>

<p>
"What for?"
</p>

<p>
"Safety," he said soberly.  "It all depends on whether a
certain gentleman now in custody gets clear as he's
promised.  Now think!"
</p>

<p>
That evening, before he went to dinner, he made his last
arrangements for the guarding of Lew Mecklen.  He made
a personal inspection of the cell, "fanned" the gunman
himself for additional assurance in case he should have
succeeded in concealing a weapon, and appointed three men
with over ten years' service to watch the man, with three
others to relieve them at 2 a.m.  He left a last warning.
</p>

<p>
"If Lew gets away, somebody's hopes of promotion'll
be gone for ever!  Anything that's sent in to him is to be
kept from him until after I've seen it to-morrow morning.
He's not to have the privilege of ordering anything
whatever from outside—you can tell him all his money's gone
to pay his hospital bill.  Nobody is to be allowed to enter
the cell—don't even go in yourselves, unless he looks like
dying.  That's all.  If the Triangle scores again, I should
say the Chief Commissioner'll crucify every man in C
Division with his own hands!"
</p>

<p>
It was perhaps lucky for several people that Storm had
exaggerated the brutality of Sir Brodie Smethurst.
</p>

<p>
The circumstances, as far as one can collate the
depositions of those concerned, were as follows:
</p>

<p>
About nine p.m. that night Police Constable C811, who
was standing at the corner of Marshall Street and Broad
Street, was approached by a bulky ruffian whose dissonant
caterwauling was clearly a public nuisance.  On being
requested to desist, the large one smote C811 with some
strength and his boot, even upon the shins, and was
promptly taken into custody.  Leading his captive up
Marshall Street, C811 met three other musicians who, linked
arm in arm, were making the night air hideous with their
attempts to harmonise <i>Rose in the Bud</i> and <i>Annie Laurie</i>.
C811 told them to shut up, whereupon the three ranged
themselves in line before him, chorused a hearty <i>tu quoque</i>
plus a vulgar expletive, and switched over to a pathetic
rendering, in comparative unison, of Tosti's <i>Good-bye</i>.
They also were added to the bag, and the four were shot
into the charge room of Marlborough Street Police Station,
certified drunk and accused of being disorderly withal,
and locked up to await judgment in the morning.
</p>

<p>
They had scarcely been removed to the cells when Police
Constable C796 arrived, having in tow two troubadours
looking distinctly the worse for wear, whom he charged
with conducting a free fight in Regent Street in the course
of which they smashed a shop window.  They also were
placed in durance vile.
</p>

<p>
Meantime, four husky specimens, who looked like farm
hands in London for the day, had drawn up in line before
the station entrance, teetering somewhat unstably on their
heels, and had commenced to regale the man on duty at the
door with <i>Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag</i>—a
subtle jest which was not appreciated until later.  After
enduring their immelodious advice for some minutes, the
doorkeeper descended the steps and invited the four bards
to move on.  The man who seemed to be the leader of the
troupe failed to understand.
</p>

<p>
"Move on?" he hiccuped, swaying slightly.  "Norra
bi'vit <i>hic!</i>  Thish—thish, of'cer—thish"—-he tapped the
Law solemnly on the thorax—"<i>hic!</i> thish commun'ty
singin'.  Finesthingin—<i>hic!</i>—England.  Go 'way.  Don' spoil
gai'ty vnations."  He turned to his waiting choir.
"Nowthnboys—sh-show thish of'cer wotchen <i>hic!</i> do.  Now.
Al'gether."
</p>

<p>
Whereon the welkin of Marlborough Street rang with a
cacophonous interpretation of <i>Three o'Clock in the Morning</i>,
the chronological inaccuracy of which ancient ditty they
appeared to perceive, for they made of it an apologetically
discordant dirge.  After three more unavailing efforts to
make them cease their serenade, or to inflict it on another
thoroughfare, the door-keeper arrested them, and they were
marched into the station still wailing the refrain of that
touching ballad <i>Bye Bye, Blackbird</i>.
</p>

<p>
And now a problem arose.  No police station has more
than seven cells, and by then all those at Marlborough
Street were occupied.  Appealed to for instructions, the
Divisional Inspector scratched his head, for more than one
prisoner cannot be placed in the same cell except during
riots.  The four songsters, having been roughly searched
and charged, were now lined up at one end of the charge
room abiding the Inspector's decision on this knotty point,
and their persistent warbling was not helpful.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "... When somebaaaady waits for meee<br>
  (Shoogar's sweet, saow is sheee),<br>
              Baaaye-baaaye, blackburrrd.<br>
  Naowone used to laave 'rr understaaand meee,<br>
  Naowone knows——"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"SHUT UP!" bellowed the frantic Inspector, whom this
ghastly vocalism was rapidly driving to the verge of
insanity, and added a virulent commination.
</p>

<p>
He telephoned to Vine Street, only to learn that the more
aristocratic police station was already full.  Unwisely, he
chose to exercise his own authority without appealing to
headquarters.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "... Make maaye bed 'n' laaaight the laaaight,<br>
  Aiyull be home late to-naaight,<br>
              Blackburrrd, Baaaye-baaaye!"<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The lullaby howled on to an appallingly strident conclusion,
and the chanticleers, without tarrying for applause,
swept on to an ear-splitting prayer that they might be
permitted to join their lost loves upon the bonny, bonny banks
of Loch Lomond.
</p>

<p>
"If this doesn't constitute a riot, God knows what does,"
squealed the Inspector in anguish.  "TAKE 'EM AWAY!!"
</p>

<p>
The four were sent to join their fellow-choristers in the
bonny, bonny cells of Marlborough Street.  Even that did
not end the torment of C Division, for within the next
half-hour they accumulated three more psalmists and two
men who had endeavoured to capture a policeman's helmet.
Towards ten o'clock, a man in a small two-seater car drove
down Marlborough Street, turned his car at right angles
across the road, and shouted to the constable at the station
entrance to stand clear, explaining that he was going to
drive right in.  He even tried to carry out his threat, and
when they went out to him they found that he was very
drunk.  What was more, he was the only one of the night's
captures whom the Divisional Inspector knew by sight.
</p>

<p>
"You're James Mattock," he said reproachfully.  "Jimmy,
we thought you'd gone respectable."
</p>

<p>
Mattock shook his head, staggering a little.  There was
a fatuous grin on his face.
</p>

<p>
"James—sh—nothin'!" he protested loudly.  "Lis'en.
Tell you ... secret.  I'm Queen 'f Sheba."
</p>

<p>
"You ought to be ashamed of yourself—an old man like
you," said the Inspector sadly.  "Take him away."
</p>

<p>
With that the influx ceased, and when a humdrum burglar
was brought in the Inspector sent him on to Vine
Street, feeling that his own preserves were already
overstocked.  There were now sixteen men divided in between
the six vacant cells, and that their lubrication had been
thorough was proved by the fact that muffled yelps of
carolling still came through the charge room door.  It was
impossible to subdue the uproar, and the reserve P.C.,
whose duty it is to make a round of the cells at half-hour
intervals, was pleading to be allowed to use chloroform.
</p>

<p>
About two a.m., when the vociferation was become
slightly hoarse and rather less enthusiastic, the reserve
constable was making the round when from one of the further
cells came a shuddering cry and the thud of a heavy fall.
Running down the corridor, the constable found that it
came from one of the cells where three men were herded
together.  One of them lay twitching on the ground, and
the other two were watching him helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"'Ad a fit," one of them muttered; and, seeing the
gaoler, added: "Fetch a doctor—Bert 'as these fits.  'Orrible,
it is."
</p>

<p>
It was just at this moment, as far as one can gather, that
a powerful lorry drew up by the kerb, almost opposite the
station but on the other side of the road, and one of the
men descended and lifted the bonnet as though to investigate
a breakdown.  The constable at the station entrance
saw the incident, but thought nothing of it.
</p>

<p>
The reserve P.C., meanwhile, not knowing what to do,
called the relief Inspector, and together they entered the
cell.
</p>

<p>
Both were promptly killed.
</p>

<p>
The three man who were guarding Mecklen rushed down
the passage at the sound of the shots and were faced by
the three prisoners—the epileptic having made a miraculous
recovery—and threatened with automatic pistols.  They were
brave men, these three constables.  Or else, perhaps, they
did not expect the three toughs to shoot.  Be that as it may,
they continued to advance, and were shot down in cold
blood.
</p>

<p>
The prisoners now moved swiftly.  They took the cell
keys from the dead bodies and released the other prisoners,
all of whom were armed.  Already there was a tumult in the
charge room, and the sixteen, with Mecklen, burst in upon
a dozen or so officers, only two of whom had had the time
or forethought to arm themselves.  The two died in their
tracks before they had time to fire a shot, and the others
paused aghast.  In another second the seventeen men were
streaming across the road to the waiting lorry, the hind-most
firing random bullets backwards to discourage pursuit.
They piled in, and the lorry moved off, gathering speed,
to the accompaniment of a final volley from the escaped
prisoners.  Before the pursuing constables, who were now
armed, could return the fusillade, the lorry had turned
a corner and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
The Flying Squad and all reserves of every Division were
called out, and those first on the scene commandeered cars
and taxis and dashed off in chase, but the seventeen, with
their lorry, got clean away.  As has been stated, the P.C. at
the door had not taken much notice of the lorry, and its
number plates had been so caked with mud as to be
indecipherable from across the road, in the dim light.  And,
standing midway between two street lamps, at night, one big
lorry looks very much like another—the doorkeeper was
unable even to identify the make with certainty, although
he thought it looked like a Rossleigh.
</p>

<p>
But the most remarkable feature of the crime was its
execution.  For one thing, it proved that the Alpha Triangle
had an unusually accurate knowledge of police station
routine.  In the first place, ordinary "drunks and
disorderlies," being apparently harmless and charged only with
minor offences, are not perfunctorily "fanned."  As was
demonstrated at the subsequent inquiry, it would have been
possible for a man not suspected of carrying arms to have
concealed a small automatic pistol in a holster strapped to
the small of his back, with little risk of it being discovered
in a more or less formal search; and in the absence of
definite information this theory is the one which is now
universally admitted satisfactorily to account for the
Triangle's success.  Secondly, the locks of the cell doors, and
those of the doors leading from the charge room to the
cells, can only be opened by a special manipulation of the
keys which is a police secret; yet the prisoners had clearly
been well instructed in this trick beforehand by someone
with an intimate knowledge of that secret, for there was no
delay in liberating the occupants of the other cells.
</p>

<p>
The third curious point was that Mattock was found in
his cell efficiently gagged and bound with strips of his own
shirt.  His explanation that he had been set upon and trussed
by the two who shared his confinement, just before the
prisoners made their escape, was accepted.  Experts
declared that he could not possibly have tied himself up so
thoroughly, and no one had seen him in the affray; furthermore,
the head waiter of the Leroy swore that Mattock had
entered the bar late that evening, already more than a trifle
"oiled," and had imbibed continuously until closing time.
Mattock was fined for being drunk in charge of a motor-car,
and was discharged on the other count.
</p>

<p>
It was a verdict which did not please Inspector Teal, for
he could have sworn that the ghost of a wink trembled on
Mattock's right eyelid as the clerk left the court.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII
<br><br>
BIRDIE RECEIVES ORDERS
</h3>

<p>
"We don't want to lose you," said Mr. Brome carefully,
"so we think you ought to go."
</p>

<p>
His pale blue eyes bored inexorably into Mecklen's.  Before
that stony stare the gunman's gaze fell, and his truculent
protest, that had framed itself instinctively, died
unvoiced.
</p>

<p>
"Aw—guess you're right, Chief," he muttered sheepishly.
"But, naow I'm hyar——"
</p>

<p>
"What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Et's thet skirt.  Chief, haow c'n I look af-ter thet li'l'
one-way sweedie when every goldurned bull in this hyar
burg is out gunnin' fer mine?  I'll say it ain't no cinch.
Arden's too fly, an' he's her lovin' sugar-daddy.  I reckon he's
gotten every lallapaloozer in this deck skinned a mile."
</p>

<p>
Snooper regarded him contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
They were in the gorgeous sitting-room of Joan Sands'
Cornwall House flat, and the magnificent furnishings were
in strange contrast to the group of men who sat around
the table.  Snooper Brome was the only one of that
down-at-heel and flashy convocation who could by any stretch of
imagination be said to fit—despite his vulgarian notions of
waistcoat design, he had a certain dignity which carried
them off rather well.  For all his bulk, he had not much
superfluous flesh, and he was anything but gross; his big
features were clean cut—with his flowery vest and white
hands, and the mane of dank black hair that swept back
from his high forehead, he resembled a prosperous
exponent of Impressionism.
</p>

<p>
The others were less favoured.  Mecklen, standing by
the door twisting a greasy tweed cap in his grimy hands,
unshaven and coarse of face, was a repulsive sight.  The
rest of the men, who sat at the long board over which
Brome presided, were divided between the extremes of
shabbiness and overdressedness.
</p>

<p>
"Are you getting panic too?" demanded Snooper, grittily
speculative.
</p>

<p>
"Yew said a canful," agreed Mecklen complacently.  "Let
me give Arden his fer a start, an' then I'll tackle thet
Jane—but while thet perambulatin' hunk of sudden death's still
millin' round, this chile's gonna stick close home.  Tell yuh
what, Chief, ef yew'll give the word I'll glom the first
freight fer Ardensville, an' when I git home they'll be
liftin' him inter his Kingdom-Come-box wit' a derrick,
he'll be thet leaded up.  An' <i>af-ter</i> thet, I'll go chase yore
Jane."
</p>

<p>
"What is the answer to that?" asked Snooper, turning
to Morini.
</p>

<p>
Gat looked at his friend.
</p>

<p>
"The answer, Lew, is," he said, "when Hell snows over.
Big Chief Triangle wants to save that little baby boy, and
what Big Chief Triangle says goes."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Brome extracted a cigar from a pocket of his flamboyant
waistcoat and cut the tip from it with a gold pen-knife.
Then he looked up at Mecklen.
</p>

<p>
"You heard?"
</p>

<p>
"I heard, Chief, but what I wanna say is——"
</p>

<p>
"What you're going to do, is—go home, Lew," remarked
Eddie sharply.  "Go home, and stick close home like you
said you were going to.  When I want you I'll send for you.
Go to Buckingham Gate, and if I hear of you showing
your nose outside again unless I give the word—it won't
be only the bulls who'll be out gunning for yours.  Beat it!"
</p>

<p>
Mecklen glared.  He was not a man of equable temper,
and the wintry scorn of Snooper's tone, no less than the
consciousness of mastery that literally crackled about the
words, got right up under Mecklen's pachydermis and
rasped on his vanity.  He started forward with a torrid
word on his lips and brazen defiance in his mien.
</p>

<p>
"Yew see hyar..."
</p>

<p>
Brome did nothing, said nothing.  He was lighting his
cigar, and he never even looked up.  His superiority wrapped
him round like a sheet of defensive fire.  It was a way of
meeting rebellion which Mecklen had never encountered
before, and before the Unknown the fear of the brute killer
roused.  If Snooper had met ferocity with ferocity, if his
right hand had dropped the match it held and slid down
towards his hip, the Alpha Triangle might have been
smithereened at that instant.  It was a peril the leaders of
the Triangle faced daily—hourly—from minute to minute.
Under them were killers, ruthless and inhuman tigers, with
the ungovernable passions of the wild beasts; and these a
mere handful of men essayed to rule and direct.  They did
it by setting themselves aloof, enveloping themselves in an
aura of superiority, and before their caustic hauteur their
hired butchers shrank back in perplexity.  Snooper, calm and
self-assured, dealt with Lew Mecklen in just that fashion.
He ignored him.  He appeared to have forgotten his
existence, and certainly he gave no sign of considering him
seriously.  The gunman's words trailed away.  He was up
against something he couldn't understand, and the ingrained
instinct of self-preservation flared a red danger signal
before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Guess yew said it, boss," he muttered angrily.
</p>

<p>
Snooper did not look up until the door had closed
behind the baffled Lew.  And when he spoke he made no
mention of the incident; but its effect was not lost on his
audience.  Only Morini was not awed—but then, Gat Morini
was nearly as intelligent as Snooper himself.
</p>

<p>
"The bomb goes off in about two hours," said Mr. Brome.
"So keep clear of Piccadilly Circus on your way
home.  It'll be the crowning stroke—and the beauty of it is
that we can go on dealing out crowning strokes for weeks.
We've fought off the police, we've rescued prisoners twice,
and we're killing those we've threatened as well.  At
midnight we shall have caused an explosion which will startle
the country."
</p>

<p>
He stopped, intent on the vision of power that retrospection
gave him.  The others, only half understanding, waited
for him to speak again.
</p>

<p>
"Arden must go—and the girl.  Those are the Apex's
orders.  I'll arrange that to-morrow—they're dangerous."
</p>

<p>
He tugged at the ornate fob which graced the southwest
of his abdomen, and brought into view a gold repeater.
</p>

<p>
"The Triangle's about due to speak to you himself.  I've
heard all he's got to say, and I've got some work to do
to-night, so I'll move off.  I'll be back later.  Morini can fix
the telephone."
</p>

<p>
He departed, and Morini rose to obey.
</p>

<p>
The telephone stood on a small corner table.  Morini
took up the instrument and pulled out the flex from the
wall plug into which it fitted.  He carried it over to a side
shelf and brought back instead a polished box lidded with
ebonite, on the surface of which was an engraved dial and
two frosted bulbs.  From the centre protruded the curved
horn of a loud-speaker.  He plugged the terminals of a
piece of flex, which ran from the rear of the box, into the
slots at the end of the permanent telephone wiring, and
connected two other wires between the amplifier and an
accumulator which he fetched from a cupboard.  The ordinary
installation had now been converted into a loud-speaking
telephone, and the flat nickelled button of a small but
supersensitive microphone let into the front of the
amplifier case acted as the receptive part of the instrument.
</p>

<p>
Then the men sat round the table, conversing desultorily,
to await the voice of their leader.  It is a good example of
the cautious foresight of the Apex, that orders which, if
they were definitely traced to him, would be of great
assistance to the Public Prosecutor, were invariably given by a
palpably disguised voice speaking to his subordinates from
none knew where.
</p>

<p>
Presently the loud-speaker broke into that sizzling mumble
which denotes the opening of the circuit, and a moment
later it spoke, with the muffled harshness that is
inseparable from electrically transmitted speech.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?"
</p>

<p>
They gave their names, one by one, and the numbers
they held in the organisation.  There followed a pause, as
though the speaker was checking the list.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"To the sixteen men who accomplished the rescue of
Mecklen"—here followed their names, read twice over—"a
bonus of one hundred pounds per man.  It will be paid
in a few days by Brome.  I add my congratulations on the
efficiency with which the man[oe]uvre was carried out."
</p>

<p>
A second interval, while the loud-speaker hissed quietly.
</p>

<p>
"Arden must be taken to-morrow.  Brome has all instructions.
The following will report to him at Church Street,
Kensington, at eight a.m. to-morrow, to receive their
orders: Lanzani, Sacco, Coles, Horring, Manuelo, Liebessohn.
I'll repeat that.  Church Street, Kensington, eight
to-morrow morning: Lanzani, Sacco, Coles, Horring,
Manuelo, Liebessohn.  Arden will be taken to Number Two.
As soon as that has been done, the same men will be
instructed how to proceed with the removal of Hawthorne.
Is that perfectly clear, Lanzani—Sacco—Coles?——"
</p>

<p>
One by one the six answered in the affirmative, and then
there was another silence.
</p>

<p>
"Sands!"
</p>

<p>
Birdie looked up with a start.
</p>

<p>
"Yessir?"
</p>

<p>
"Go to the cupboard between the windows.  Are you
there?  Right.  Open it.  Inside you will find a small copper
vessel.  Take it out—and handle it carefully, because if
you dropped it Cornwall House would be seriously
damaged.  Got it?"
</p>

<p>
Birdie, after a moment's hesitation, had gingerly removed
a little calorimeter, and was holding it as far away
from his body as possible.  He passed his tongue across his
lips nervously.
</p>

<p>
"Yessir," he croaked.
</p>

<p>
"You have nothing to be afraid of as long as you're careful,"
the Voice went on.  "I have chosen you specially on
account of your delicate fingers—-I shouldn't trust any of
the others to move that stuff with safety.  Don't be scared.
If you tremble it may slip out of your hand.  Now look at it.
There's a tiny bottle inside, isn't there, and the space
between the bottle and the calorimeter is filled with chipped
ice?  Good.  I'll tell you why that is.  That phial contains the
highest explosive known to science, but by a special process
it has been made less dangerous than it is in the ordinary
way.  The only things that will detonate it now are
heat—that is the reason for the ice—or a severe shock,
such as you might give it if you let it fall.  Is that clear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yessir."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  You know the <i>Daily Record</i> offices?"
</p>

<p>
"Yessir."
</p>

<p>
"You have made yourself familiar with the appearance
of John Cardan, the editor, as you were told to—you are
sure you can recognise him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yessir."
</p>

<p>
"Excellent.  Then you will go at once to Ludgate Circus,
taking a ninety-six 'bus, and wait outside the office.  Take
the calorimeter with you.  He leaves the office between
half-past eleven and midnight.  When he comes out, take the
little bottle out of the ice, and slip it into his pocket.  Then
walk quietly away—the explosive will take a little time to
warm, and that'll give you as long as you need to get out
of range without attracting attention.  Have you got hold
of all that?"
</p>

<p>
"Yessir."
</p>

<p>
"You can keep the stuff in your pocket—the ice will
make it perfectly safe unless you should happen to fall
down.  Now please tell me exactly what you are going to
do."
</p>

<p>
Birdie licked his lips again, and then recited his orders
haltingly.  Once or twice he was pulled up, and he was not
allowed to go until he had mastered every detail.  At last the
rehearsal seemed to satisfy the Voice, and he was dismissed.
He put the calorimeter with its deadly burden into his jacket
pocket, keeping his fingers round it to prevent the ice
spilling, and shuffled to the door, white-faced and shaking.
</p>

<p>
"So long, mates," he chattered with a rickety attempt
at jauntiness.  "See you all later...."
</p>

<p>
Then he was gone.
</p>

<p>
"Martinez will drive Morini down to the Embankment
immediately," continued the Voice.  "You will try to remove
Inspector Teal.  Morini will shoot, and Martinez will then
drive back to Buckingham Gate via Blackfriars Bridge and
Road, Lambeth Road, Lambeth High Street, Broad Street,
Prince's Road, Kennington Street, Upper Kennington
Lane, Vauxhall Bridge, Grosvenor Road, Chelsea Bridge
Road.  Go through Hammersmith, circle back via Chiswick,
go north through Hampstead, and get to Buckingham
Gate by way of Tottenham Court Road, Charing Cross
Road, and the Mall.  I'll repeat that.  Take down the important
points on a scrap of paper.  Ready?  Blackfriars Bridge,
Lambeth, Vauxhall Bridge, Chelsea, Hammersmith, Cheswick,
Hampstead, Tottenham Court Road.  Right.  One other
thing.  Wait till you get Teal alone.  If he comes out with
Arden, follow and watch your chance.  The usual bonuses
will be..."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"<i>Teal!  Isn't radio wonderful!</i>" murmured a flippant
voice.
</p>

<p>
Every man in the room spun round.  With their backs
to the door, they had been so absorbed in the words of their
Chief that they had never noticed the faint creak of the
opening door, nor the two soft paces that had brought
Storm and Teal into their presence.
</p>

<p>
They jerked round as though hot needles had been run
into them, half rising from their seats, with groping amazement
in their faces.  The microphone had proved its utility,
and the loud-speaker had suddenly gone dead.  The men
who had been listening to it stood rooted to the ground,
petrified, while they strove to whip their minds into grasping
the situation.  Storm watched them, smiling, a cigarette
between his lips, his hands deep in his pockets.  Beside him,
the torpid avoirdupois of Mr. Teal leaned against the
door, expressionless of face, motionless except for the
intermittent oscillation of his inferior maxilla.
</p>

<p>
Storm's lazy grey eyes swept their blank faces.
</p>

<p>
"I hope we don't intrude!" he drawled politely.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII
<br><br>
PESSIMISM OF MR. TEAL
</h3>

<p>
Morini was the first to recover his equilibrium.  He swept
a deep bow.
</p>

<p>
"You're welcome," he said.  "Come right in—how did
you get in, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
"The door was open," said Storm.  "So, as we meant to
pay you a call, we thought we wouldn't put you to the
trouble of locking and bolting it."
</p>

<p>
Teal was inspecting with interest the playing cards and
markers that lay on the table.
</p>

<p>
"What's the game?" he asked inquisitorially, addressing
the redoubtable Horring; but that holdup expert was
less suave than his confrère.
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to know the meaning of this intrusion," he
broke out heatedly.  "I don't know what sort of a country
you call this, if a few friends can't get together for a round
of cribbage without policemen——"
</p>

<p>
Teal cut short his protest with one raised reproving hand.
</p>

<p>
"I shan't argue," he stated mildly.  "I suppose <i>-age</i> does
enter into it."
</p>

<p>
He could be subtle on occasions, could Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
Storm wandered over to the loud-speaking telephone and
examined it curiously.  Eventually he traced the flex which
contacted with the telephone plug, and disconnected it.  He
looked round for the telephone proper, and, locating it,
fetched it over and connected it up.
</p>

<p>
"2 LO seems to have closed down," he remarked.  "A
pity—I love listening in!"
</p>

<p>
He looked at Morini with a quizzical smile, as though
expecting the obvious rejoinder to come from that quarter;
but, if this was his hope, he was disappointed.  Then he lifted
the receiver and waited with it held to his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Exchange? ... I've just been called, and I think we've
been cut off.  Can you tell me where the ring came from? ... What's
that? ... Are you stone-cold certain? ... Well, pass
me on to Supervisor ... Supervisor? ... I'm Captain
Arden of Criminal Investigation Department.  I want you to
make absolutely certain whether any call has been put
through to this number during the last hour...."  There
was a longer delay, and then he got his answer.  "Thanks
very much.  Good-bye."
</p>

<p>
He turned his back to the table and lounged against it,
his eyes narrowing.
</p>

<p>
"I'm told," he said, "that this number hasn't been called
since this morning.  Broadcasting with an ordinary
telephone is a joke I'm not going to buy!"
</p>

<p>
Their dumbfounded faces were his answer.  It was as
clear as anything ever has been that they were no more able
to account for the facts than he was.  Even Morini's
composure suffered a jar, and the pucker that appeared
between his eyebrows indicated that he was endeavouring to
reach an explanation.
</p>

<p>
Storm examined the wall plug, and found two insulated
wires running down the wainscot and stretching along the
floor in the groove between the ceil and the carpet.  They
led him halfway round the room and then right-angled
round the frame of a door.  Trying the handle, Storm found
that it was locked.
</p>

<p>
"I'll have the key, please," he requested.
</p>

<p>
"We haven't got it."  It was Morini who made the
disclaimer.  In the absence of any acknowledged leader, he
automatically answered for all.
</p>

<p>
"Explain!" Storm rapped back.
</p>

<p>
Morini shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"You want a whole lot of help, Captain," he gibed.  "I
thought you were Mother's Infant Prodigy.  If you don't
know, I'll tell you that door opens into a flat that's really part
of this one, but the dame who lives there's gotten very
proper notions about ladyhood, and we poor common folks
aren't allowed to go in.  She's just the obliging owner who
lets us use this room to talk in—there's two entrances, and
she keeps her own one private."
</p>

<p>
"What name?"
</p>

<p>
"Ask me again, Doc.  We've never seen her."
</p>

<p>
Storm reached to his hip and took out a compact wallet
from which he selected a skeleton key of a type appropriate
to the make of lock.  He was successful at the first
attempt, and the door creaked open on unoiled hinges.
</p>

<p>
"Look after these gay birds, Teal," he ordered, and
passed into the other flat.
</p>

<p>
He found himself in a tastefully furnished sitting-room
in the decoration of which the work of a woman's hand was
evident.  He only stopped to glance behind and under the
chesterfield, and then went through the door which faced
him.  He arrived in a light airy double bedroom, and here
again the signs of feminine habitation were not lacking;
but this, too, was empty, though he peered under the bed
and tentatively prodded the dresses which hung in the
wardrobe in quest of a cached fugitive.  He moved on to the
bathroom, but discovered no one lurking there.
</p>

<p>
After that futile search he recollected the telephone wire,
and went back to trace it.  It ran around the sitting-room
and disappeared over the sill of a window.  Leaning out, he
saw that it hitched over a common porcelain insulator—from
which it swept off to join the junction of other telephone
wires.  The result dissatisfied him, and he tracked the
wire a second time, and on this journey he found that it was
tapped very neatly, the secondary wires running under the
carpet out of sight.  Without compunction he shifted all the
furniture which stood in the way, and rolled back the rugs,
disclosing twin threads that crossed the floor.  Following
them up, he trailed them to a bookcase, and saw that they
vanished into a hole trimly bored in the base.
</p>

<p>
He stood up and scrutinised the shelves.  One row of
leather-bound volumes struck him as being rather too good
to be true, and he essayed to open the glass-fronted door in
order to make a closer study, but found that it was fastened.
Once again he had recourse to his wallet, and after a few
minutes' work with a small steel instrument he had the case
open.  He now found that the row of books was simply a
range of dummy backs, which he could pull wide like a
second door, revealing a small cupboard.  Within he brought
to light what he had more or less expected—a phone
transmitter mounted on a bracket, and a pair of radio
headphones.  These he removed, and then pushed back the secret
door and, after some difficulty, relocked the case over it.
The rest would keep; and he left the instruments on a chair
and went back into the larger sitting-room, closing the
partition door behind him.
</p>

<p>
"What're we going to do with these people?" he
interrogated the detective, and Teal spread out his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Suspected of conspiracy—Vine Street <i>pro tem</i>.  We
didn't hear much of that broadcast sermon, but we did hear
somebody telling 'em to express me to a better world," he
added with grim amusement.
</p>

<p>
Morini's hand went to his hip, and in answer to that
movement Teal shifted something in his hand so that the
light caught it.  He did not seem to have stirred a fraction—his
jaw still vacillated mechanically, and his tired eyes
showed little sign of animation.  But the fact remained
that a wicked-looking Webley had flown into his right hand
and was even then focused upon the gunman.
</p>

<p>
To his concealed surprise, Morini smiled, and brought
up his hand with nothing in it more lethal than a
cigarette-case.
</p>

<p>
"You're too suspicious, officer," Gat observed.  "Shooting
you with Captain Arden for a witness would be foolish.
No.  I was just about to point out that police stations
and Flying Squad vans haven't exactly proved to be the
real original cat's pyjamas so far, have they?"
</p>

<p>
Storm conferred aside with the detective.
</p>

<p>
"Would conspiracy to murder be a sound charge?"
</p>

<p>
"Granted it only gets two of 'em—you've got special
powers, haven't you?"
</p>

<p>
"I doubt if my special powers'd be superior to a writ
of <i>habeas corpus</i>" Storm objected.
</p>

<p>
Teal shrugged.
</p>

<p>
"It's worth trying," he said.  "The only thing is, we'd
have to send 'em to Pentonville right away—stations don't
seem to hold 'em.  Even if we put 'em in stir straight off, I
shouldn't bet on their staying put—the Triangle might
turn up with an amateur Army Corps and besiege the jail,"
he added morosely, and Storm laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Pollyanna—you little ray of sunshine—shut up!"
</p>

<p>
The Triangle menace was festering to a head, and for
all the lightness of his tone he knew it.  It was the season
for striking swift blows, here, there, and everywhere.  From
then onwards the gang must be attacked and raided wherever
and whenever the dimmest spook of half an opportunity
showed its tail.  The risk of lowering police prestige still
further by giving the Triangle the chance to make yet
another daring coup must be taken.  The Triangle must be set
on the run, and kept there—hazed, harassed and bulldozed
into confusion, till they didn't know whether they were
coming or going.
</p>

<p>
Storm telephoned the prison and ordered a van with
double escort to be sent immediately.  It would take some
time to arrive, and he followed the order with a call to Vine
Street asking for a dozen men to guard the prisoners
meantime.  He had seen the microphone attached to the loud
speaker.  Already the Big Triangle knew of his presence,
and he did not put it above the capabilities of that
stupendous brain to organise a lightning sortie to rescue their
captives before a conveyance could reach Cornwall House.
</p>

<p>
"Put your hands high over your heads and face along
that wall," he commanded the prisoners, and they obeyed
without demur.
</p>

<p>
Their position did not seem to trouble them at all, and
this earnest of their confidence in the Apex was somewhat
disquieting.  Storm and the detective watched them,
cat-eyed, until the men from Vine Street arrived.  Then the
captives were searched, and Storm sat down to smoke a
cigarette while he waited for the prison van.  It came
surprisingly quickly.  The prisoners were rushed down the stairs
into the street, loaded into the Maria, and three of the Vine
Street plain-clothes men crammed in on top of them to
reinforce the warders.  All the captives were handcuffed
together in a string and the end handcuffs were locked over
staples on the inside of the van.
</p>

<p>
"They'll be blistering miracles if they get out of that
mess!" said Storm, watching the red tail-light speed down
Piccadilly.
</p>

<p>
After that the other detectives were dismissed, and
Storm and Teal returned to make a more thorough search
of the inner flat.  They stopped en route to look over the
assembly room, and it was while they were there that Storm
distinctly heard the sound of a door closing in the next
flat.
</p>

<p>
Teal's ears intercepted the dull click at the same time,
and the two jumped for the partition door.  The sitting-room
was empty, but in that cursory glance round Storm
saw that the headpieces and transmitter he had left on a
chair had vanished.  He jerked open the bedroom door and
ran through into the bathroom, but there was no one to
be seen.  And then a second door slammed, and he whipped
round with a frown.  Almost at once he grasped his mistake.
</p>

<p>
"Je-rusalem—the hall!" he snapped, and led the way
back through the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
Besides the door into the bedroom there was another
which he had missed, masked behind a heavy curtain.  He
flung it open and entered a tiled lobby furnished only with
a hat-stand and an occasional table.  Opening the farther
door, he found himself in the corridor, and sprinted for the
stairs.
</p>

<p>
He overtook nobody in his headlong descent, and he saw
nobody he recognised in the street.  The porter's cubicle
at the entrance was empty, and while Storm stroked his
chin in perplexity that worthy toiler came across the road
singing a little tune.
</p>

<p>
"I run out of fags," he replied to Storm's brisk query.
"I just went over to a slot machine up the street.  No, not
five minutes ago—shortly after all those men came out."
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen any other guys come out or go in?" asked
Storm, and the man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
Kit climbed the stairs again with a frown, and found
Teal ruminating torpidly in the bedroom.  The detective was
dangling a flimsy article of feminine underwear in one of
his vast paws.
</p>

<p>
"This is embroidered 'J.S.'," he said.  "Sounds like my
old friend Joan to me."
</p>

<p>
Storm scowled.
</p>

<p>
"D'you know we're a couple of dyed-in-the-wool mutts?"
he demanded.  "I'm willing to bet the Big Triangle was lying
doggo in the vestibule all the time I was making that first
search—I never spotted the hall.  And when I went back
to the big room he must have padded back and listened to
everything we said....  <i>God's Glory!</i>"
</p>

<p>
The oath cracked out like the lash of a stock-whip, and
Teal's eyes opened wide at the sibilant intensity of it.
</p>

<p>
Storm had picked up a brass candlestick, and he smashed
it into the glass front of one of the compartments of the
bookcase.  He wrenched Open the dummy line of books, and
then stepped back with his lips lifting from his white teeth.
</p>

<p>
The headphones and mouthpiece were back in their
places, connected up.
</p>

<p>
"Great Thor in hell!" he breathed.
</p>

<p>
In an instant he was back to the outer sitting-room.  He
grabbed up the telephone and gave a number even as Teal,
moving with astonishing speed, arrived behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo," snapped Arden.  "<i>Hullo</i> ... Pentonville? ... How
long have you been on duty? ... Right.  Then what
time did you get my order for the prison van? ... I
see."  Storm's voice suddenly became gentle.  "You're absolutely
certain no call could have come through and been taken by
someone else?  ...  Oh—about half an hour ago....  Arden,
Central Office, five-double-seven—you poor fish.  Why not
think of asking before? ... Well, get me the Governor....
My dear good soul, I don't care if he's asleep—I don't care
if he'll be furious—I don't care if he's dying!
<i>Get—me—the—Governor</i>....  Thank you."
</p>

<p>
A lengthy pause, and then a querulous growl:
</p>

<p>
"Yes?"
</p>

<p>
"Colonel Dayne?"
</p>

<p>
The affirmative was unprintable.
</p>

<p>
"I called you up about half an hour ago and ordered
your van to Cornwall House.  A van came, but apparently
it was a fake.  I want you to send a man down to your
garage and find out if your van is there."
</p>

<p>
Storm got his answer in about ten minutes, and then he
set down the receiver and whistled musically, strolling up
and down the room.  The expression on his face made it
unnecessary for Mr. Teal to ask any questions.
</p>

<p>
The Triangle had scored again, right under their noses.
The fake van must have been waiting for just such an
emergency, and the Apex had had all the odds in his
favour—he had heard Storm and Teal come, heard their
plans, and was already tapped in on the telephone to waylay
their message and send a totally different one along to
his confederates.  The luck of the game had been his down
to the last milligramme.
</p>

<p>
"The only consolation is that the Press won't hear about
our wiped eyes," said Teal gloomily, and Storm stopped
whistling to grin.
</p>

<p>
"Don't bet on it," he recommended.  "The Triangle might
mail a graphic account to all the News Agencies.  If I were
the Apex, and I'd scooped the kitty like that with a pair
of deuces, I'll say I'd sing about it!"
</p>

<p>
It took a lot to upset Storm.  The inevitable cigarette
lofted heavenwards between his smiling lips, his hands were
deep in his pockets—that boyish enthusiasm, which nothing
could damp, shone in his eyes.  It was an attribute of
his which, delightful in the ordinary way, could be
incredibly aggravating in moments of stress, and Inspector Teal
glared at him moodily.
</p>

<p>
<i>Zzzzzzing! ... Zzzzzzing-zing! ...</i>
</p>

<p>
Through the other flat the hall bell jingled shrilly.
</p>

<p>
"One rings!" said Storm brightly.  "Teal, be a good boy
and come greet the visitor!"
</p>

<p>
He went through to answer the door, Teal following.  As
he flung it wide the corridor light outside showed up a
stumpy, rotund form surmounted by a chubby pink face
which split in a jovial beam as it recognised the two men
who stood in the hall surveying it.
</p>

<p>
Teal reached out a languid arm and took the newcomer
by the wrist, drawing him inside and kicking the door shut
behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Come right in, Uncle Joe," said Mr. Teal with savage
cordiality.  "Come right in and open your sweet heart to
old Uncle Claud Eustace.  He wants to hear a little fairy
tale about loud-speaking telephones!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap19"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX
<br><br>
NCl<sub>3</sub>
</h3>

<p>
Joe Blaythwayt waddled into the sitting-room.  He
turned and gaped at the detective.
</p>

<p>
"Loud Speaking Telephones?" he repeated in an awed
whisper.  "My dear sir—my Very Dear
Sir—I—er—I—I—I——"  His fishlike mouth
closed with a smack.  "Why,
what a coincidence!  Finding you here, I mean.  I didn't
know you were friends of Jimmy's."
</p>

<p>
A gargantuan grin overspread Teal's homely features
with the slow ponderous momentum of an incoming tide.
Jimmy; James Norman Mattock.  The connection with Joan
Sands had eluded Mr. Teal, but now it had been suggested
to him his mind invested it with all the immutable actuality
of proven fact.  The truth sounds almost sacrilegious, but
it is that Claud Eustace Teal, flushed with the joy of
discovery, was composing a little song on the lines of a
well-known nursery rhyme.  It ran something like this—
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Mattock had a little Joan<br>
  Whose soul was blushing poor,<br>
  And everywhere lamb Mattock went<br>
  His Joan went on before.<br>
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Mr. Teal was not a great poet, but he had a wonderful
knack of getting a stranglehold on axioms.
</p>

<p>
"Funny that Jimmy never occurred to me," he said.
"Let's take another look at that flat."
</p>

<p>
A novel lay on one chair, and when Storm picked it up
to read the title a thin yellow envelope fell out.  It was
addressed to J.N. Mattock, and the postmark showed that
it had been mailed in Putney at 2 p.m. the previous day.
Storm smoothed put the slip of expensive creamy
notepaper which it contained.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="report">
Raegenssen having disappeared, the office can probably

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
The signature was the device of the Alpha Triangle.
</p>

<p>
Storm passed the letter over to Teal, and when the
detective had read it he pursed his lips.
</p>

<p>
"He's the sort of snake who would have an alibi handy,"
was Mr. Teal's sour comment.
</p>

<p>
The voice they had heard over the telephone was certainly
that of a man—but whose?  Mattock's?  Blaythwayt's?
Teal could arrive at no plausible solution.  And an odd
dozen little Triangles had slithered through their fingers
that night, winning clear on the blindest, most hopeless
bluff that had ever been put up in the history of New
Scotland Yard.  The detective was anything but satisfied with
his evening's work, and proceeded to vent his spleen on the
unhappy Joe.
</p>

<p>
"Who told you to come butting in here?" he wanted
to know.  "I'll tell you, Joe, you dillytanty bloodhounds
rile me.  Now, just you warble me that little fairy tale I
asked you for—and put in an opening chorus saying why
you come rubing round this manor at twenty to midnight."
</p>

<p>
"Really, there's no need for you to be so offensive,
Teal," Blaythwayt protested miserably.  "I happened to be
in court when Mattock was brought up after the Triangle
got Mecklen away from the station—I go round the police
courts when I've got any time to spare.  It's the best method
of seeing Life in the Raw."  Joe's tone suggested the
suppression of nameless horrors witnessed in the metropolitan
courts of summary jurisdiction.  "And I'm interested in
this case, as you know, so I shadowed Mattock home.  Then
I had to hurry away, but I wanted to ask him a few
questions, so I came along to-night."
</p>

<p>
"What questions?"
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt waggled a podgy hand.
</p>

<p>
"Material for Writing," he explained unctuously.  "One
should strive for Accuracy.  I wanted to know what it felt
like to be set upon by two scoundrels, how it was to be up
before a magistrate, and so on.  I have never been before
a magistrate, nor have I ever been molested by armed
desperados, and so I resolved to get my sensations at least at
second hand."
</p>

<p>
Storm lounged into a settee and put his feet up.  His
glance commanded Teal to cut short the persecution, for
Storm had his own idea of the right way to deal with
<i>l'affaire Blaythwayt</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You go steady, uncle!" he warned.  "If you aren't careful
you'll be sampling sensations at first hand.  Teal loves
arresting people—if I wasn't here, I'll bet he'd pull you in
on the spot!" he added, to the detective's annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"Arrest <i>me</i>?" gasped Blaythwayt as though he could
not believe his ears.
</p>

<p>
"You!"
</p>

<p>
Storm's manner differed from Teal's as much as the
attack of a tiger differs from the onslaught of an elephant.
Storm's voice was buttered and honeyed.  His words came
guilelessly, but there were little knobs and spikes sticking
out all over them under the glossy varnish.
</p>

<p>
"You!  Blaythwayt, you're playing around with matches
in a gunpowder factory!  I'll speak to you plainly, because
you're the uncle of a very great friend of mine.  And my
advice to you is—slide!  Light out over the horizon and
stay lit until this Triangle cyclone has gone past.  You'll
be safer.  Mess about with yeggs and kiters, if you like.
Even plain ornery murderers are fairly safe.  But steer wide
of Triangles!  Triangles have got death dope on every
point; they've got edges like Kropps; and there's a big
bomb packed up in the Alpha.  I don't want any dead
uncles-in-law—it kind of pancakes the marriage festivities, to go
off on your honeymoon hung round with black crepe.  I'll
tell you something: you're next on the list!  You know too
much.  Now, be a sensible fellow, and pass on what you
know, and then vamoose for the duration.  Why did you
go to Billingsgate?"
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt twiddled his fingers round his umbrella uneasily.
Once or twice his mouth opened, and then gold-fished
shut again.  Storm's tone had been very gentle, disarmingly
so, but even the innocent Joe had felt the tang of one or two
of those tiny needle-points that prickled through the velvet.
</p>

<p>
"I—er—well, I'll tell you.  Teal told me that Raegenssen
was under suspicion.  At least, he was mixed up in the
business somehow; and even if that 'somehow' was only
being one of the men the Triangle was out to kill, finding
out more about him might have given me a line on the Apex
himself."
</p>

<p>
"And how did you hear of Billingsgate?"
</p>

<p>
Joe hesitated, sucking the crook of his umbrella.  One
podgy hand went up and tilted his pot hat back from his
forehead.
</p>

<p>
"Can I speak without prejudice?" he compromised.
</p>

<p>
"More or less."
</p>

<p>
"Er—um!"  Blaythwayt scratched his head.  "Um!"  He
caught Teal's dissecting eye upon him, and dithered.  "To
tell you the truth, I was the second burglar at Raegenssen's,"
he blurted.
</p>

<p>
Storm was tapping a cigarette on his thumbnail.  Teal
was probing for a piece of gum which had lodged in one
of his molars.  The effect of the revelation was that Teal bit
his finger.
</p>

<p>
"And did you recognise anyone at Billingsgate?" asked
Storm calmly, and Joe shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Only Susan," he confessed.
</p>

<p>
"And you didn't get your line on the Big Triangle?"
</p>

<p>
"No.  But I learnt something else, and you know what it
was.  Susan saw it—I only heard of it from her," Blaythwayt
dropped his voice impressively.  "The Tunnel!"
</p>

<p>
Storm looked up.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!  Into the Tube.  Did either of you find out
where it left the Tube again?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Just by the Bank of England!" said Storm coolly, and
the Teal and Blaythwayt jaws sagged limply.  "The Alpha
Triangle was going to smash the Bank of England—they'd
got it all mapped out to a hair!  But there was just
one place where they got snookered.  Tell me that one,
Joe."
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt nodded sagely.
</p>

<p>
"The vaults are flooded at night."
</p>

<p>
Storm struck a match and applied it to his cigarette.  He
looked at the other two through a long wisp of blue smoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yeh!" he murmured.  "They ought to have tried an
easier crib.  It must have been ... peeving to have a bloomer
like that in your calculations—even if it does compensate
for having the whole balloon burst by a police raid!"
</p>

<p>
He climbed off the settee and stretched himself.  His face
was reserve itself.
</p>

<p>
"Just one other thing," he remembered.  "How did you
find out that 'Raegenssen' was 'Sud-Scandinavia Wood'?"
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt smiled.
</p>

<p>
"That was easy.  I mean to say, I couldn't be sure, but
I Had My Ideas.  Susan told me that you had been talking
about a mysterious sawmill, and, as Raegenssen's banker,
I knew that he had frequently passed cheques made payable
to the Sud-Scandinavia.  So I knew he had some
connection.  I found the address in the street directory."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks very much," said Storm casually.  "I think that's
all.  Are you going to take my tip?"
</p>

<p>
"Er—um!"  Joe looked mournful.
</p>

<p>
Storm flicked a short cylinder of ash into a flower-pot.
His cigarette twirled skywards, his shoulders squared,
his hands went deep into his trouser pockets.  He looked
down at Blaythwayt with a metallic hardness in his eyes,
and the other shuffled his feet uncertainly.
</p>

<p>
"That's my last word—skid!" drawled Storm in a
friendly tone under which only an ear attuned to his mood
would have detected the cast-iron core.  "Give her the gun,
prospective uncle-in-law, and hit her up on all six.  Chase
yourself, and touch the ground in spots.  Go rubbering round
Canada, or hunt butterflies in Peru—go any place where
they never see Triangles except in geometry books or on
beer-labels or the rear wings of autos!  Don't forget that
warning.  I'm serious!  During the next two days there're
going to be special trains running to Gehenna for everyone
who's got a line on the Big Triangle, or who's ever had
the chance to get a line on him.  The Big Triangle himself
included—that's my contribution.  You come right into that
catalogue, Blaythwayt.  Give Sherlock II a rest.  I guess he
needs it."
</p>

<p>
Never for one moment had that undercurrent of command
broken surface; but Joe felt rather than heard it, and
a flush of half-hearted obstinacy stole into his plump cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Now, when do you leave?" said Storm.
</p>

<p>
"I—er—um!"  Blaythwayt was dubious.  "I really don't
see, Captain Arden, that you've——"
</p>

<p>
<i>Zzzzzzing! ... Zzzzzzing! ... Zzzzzzing!</i>
</p>

<p>
For the second time that evening the clarion summons
of the hall bell jazzed into insistence, and Teal ceased
mastication for a couple of seconds to frown.  Followed the
clattering thump of a knocker plied by no patient hand, and
then a short pause....
</p>

<p>
<i>Zzzzzzing! ... Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzing!</i>
</p>

<p>
Something quite unrelated to any surmise about the
identity of the testy one outside prodded the conscience of
Mr. Teal, to his discomfort.  The foundation of the fact in
his misgivings was not long in receiving demonstration.
</p>

<p>
"More callers!" murmured Storm.  "I wonder who this is."
</p>

<p>
He opened the front door.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Joan Sands coldly, and marched past
him into the sitting-room.
</p>

<p>
She stood aside to allow Storm to enter, and then placed
herself across the threshold.
</p>

<p>
"Inspector Teal, I believe?" she said, looking straight at
the portly detective.
</p>

<p>
"That's right," said Teal.
</p>

<p>
Flabbergasted as he was, he could not deny her dignity.
She stood with her legs slightly astride, her white hands
loosely holding the belt of her simple tweed costume, and
a glacial inclemency had come into her baby blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Arden, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!"  Storm bowed.
</p>

<p>
Her gaze shifted to Joe Blaythwayt, who had suddenly
become conspicuous by his efforts to efface himself.
</p>

<p>
"Who's this, Arden?" she demanded.  "Is he a split too?"
</p>

<p>
Storm smiled.
</p>

<p>
"He'll bless you in his prayers if you call him that.  Let
me introduce you," he said easily.  "Mr. Blaythwayt—Miss
Sands.  I expect he knows your name.  He's Teal's father
confessor."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"What's he here for?"
</p>

<p>
"I think he dropped in for a chat with Jimmy.  Isn't that
it, Joe?"
</p>

<p>
"I—er—um!" began Joe confusedly.  "The fact is, Miss
Sands, I was especially anxious to have a Private
Conversation with your—your—um!"
</p>

<p>
He broke off and looked about him wretchedly, as though
his mind was clawing round desperately for a straw of
assistance.  His embarrassment, which increased with every
second of that awkward hiatus, was positively painful.  He
almost wriggled in his distress, and for the first time Joan
smiled.
</p>

<p>
"My lover?—I suppose that's the word you're jibbing
at?" she prompted without a tremor.  "You're unlucky."
</p>

<p>
"We thought you were away, too," said Storm brazenly,
and she swung round on him.
</p>

<p>
"So that's why you came?"
</p>

<p>
"Hardly!  We didn't think you were away until we'd
come."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him with a frown, as if she thought he was
being facetious.  He appreciated the genuineness of her
scepticism, and took the yellow envelope from his pocket and
gave it to her.  She read it through, and then opened her
bag and took out a telegram.
</p>

<p>
"I've been spending the last two days at Hindhead," she
said.  "I got this wire this afternoon, and that's all I knew
of Jimmy going away.  Read it."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
Sorry dear shan't be home when you return sent Torquay
important business back to-morrow.
</p>

<p class="letter">
JIMMY.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Storm folded the flimsy and handed it back.
</p>

<p>
"I see.  The Apex must have thought you were in town."  Storm
whistled out a long jet of smoke.  "Who knew you
were going?"
</p>

<p>
"Only Jimmy," she replied, and then once more she was
on her high horse.  "But I'm not here to be cross-examined.
I take it you've been searching my flat.  That being so, I'd
like to see your warrant."
</p>

<p>
There was an interlude of silence.  Joe had succeeded in
retiring to the ample background afforded by Mr. Teal.  The
detective, having had the guiltiness of his conscience
materialised, chewed stolidly and was tongue-tied.  Arden
coaxed his cigarette to the other corner of his mouth and
met the girl's imperious gaze levelly.
</p>

<p>
"We haven't got one," he said.  "Like Mr. Blaythwayt,
Teal and I were going to pay a little call on Jimmy, only
we got in the wrong door and found a little mothers'
meeting in progress.  We were in time for the agenda, and
stopped to—er—vote upon the motion."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be funny," she snapped.
</p>

<p>
"I'm as serious as double pneumonia," he assured her
gravely.  "Joan, don't pretend to be dense!"
</p>

<p>
"I'm only Joan to my friends, Arden," she cut him, but
he refused to be high-handed.
</p>

<p>
"I'm your friend, Joan," he said imperturbably.
"Whether you call me Captain Arden or plain Arden doesn't
bother me any, because I'm not talking for myself—there's
every mite of every law in this country, and all the power
behind the Law, concentrated in my two hands!  You may
or may not be as innocent as you seem.  We'll argue that
later.  But come a little tour of inspection and learn things!"
</p>

<p>
He led her into the outer sitting-room, and she followed
impatiently.  He pointed to the chairs drawn up
round the long table, and the marks of recent occupation in
the ash-trays and scattered cards.  He exhibited the
loud-speaking telephone, and then indicated the wire which ran
into her private flat.  He took her back and traced for her
its route across the floor, under the rugs, to the ornate
bookcase.
</p>

<p>
She did no more than cast a bored glance at each of the
damning beacons of incrimination he picked out for her
enlightenment.  Her lips were tightened up, her face a mask,
her bearing inscrutable.
</p>

<p>
Then he made her look at the bookcase.  She obeyed pettishly,
and turned to him again with a mutinous tilt to her
small chin.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" she said.  "Is that all?"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite!  You've seen the loud-speaking telephone and
you've seen the tapped wires.  You've seen how anyone
knowing the secret of that bookcase could speak through to
the other room.  Teal and I arrived in that other room in
time to hear two men detailed to murder our one and only
Inspector Teal.  We think those orders were given from
your flat.  So we're healthily curious!"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Anything but!  It isn't every day you hear the order
given for your own execution!"
</p>

<p>
She faced him boldly.
</p>

<p>
"Do you think I was the speaker?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't," said Storm.  "For one thing, the voice I heard
was too deep for the best woman mimic on earth to have
produced.  For another, you hadn't a key—you had to ring
for us to let you in.  Why did you come back if you knew
Jimmy was away?  Who was going to let you in?"
</p>

<p>
"I forgot I hadn't a key.  Jimmy lost his the other day,
and as I was going away I left him mine.  He was going
to have another key cut."
</p>

<p>
"Uh-huh.  Rather absent-minded of you!  What'd you
have done—slept on the doorstep?"
</p>

<p>
She pulled off her hat and shook out her hair.  Walking
over to a side table, she helped herself to a cigarette from
a silver box.  She turned round with the lighted match in
her hand.
</p>

<p>
"My God—are you <i>still</i> here?" she exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
"That's real Mattock," Teal said, addressing Storm.
"He tried that on me the other day."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry—we are," said Storm.  "Now hear me, Joan!
Who else had keys besides you and Jimmy?"
</p>

<p>
"No one that I know of."
</p>

<p>
Storm took a promenade up and down the room.  She
had rested against the table, and he stopped in front of her,
eyeing her steadily and forcing her to meet his gaze.  He said
nothing, simply riveted her with that thoughtful stare.
And he saw that tense silence rasp her nerves—saw her go
a little paler under the paint and powder, and saw the quick
straining heave of her bosom.  Saw her mouth twitch ever
so slightly, and saw the reflex, spasmodic jerk of her hand.
</p>

<p>
He smashed through her barricade of haughtiness by
the sheer relentless battering of his will, and at last she
turned her head away with a short shaky laugh and put a
little distance between them, placing herself on the
opposite side of the table as though to break away from that
intangible attack.
</p>

<p>
"I hate talking like a detective story," Kit Arden said
slowly, "but—if you've told me the truth—it looks
... bad ... for Jimmy, doesn't it?"
</p>

<p>
The blow that her intuition had sensed, namelessly and
without logic, had fallen.  He saw her wince and grip the
edge of the table for support.
</p>

<p>
"I don't ... understand..."
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry."  Storm relaxed.  The bombardment was
lifted.  His smile was as light and care-free as if there had
never been an Alpha Triangle mentioned in that room.
"That's all there is to be said, then.  Except that I'll ask you
to pass on to Jimmy the advice I gave Blaythwayt just before
you came in.  And that advice is, let up!  Play with fire
if you must get a kick out of life, but never do acrobatics
on the chute of a blast furnace!...  We'll move along now—I
expect you're tired."
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt, squirming and panting for relief from those
taut surroundings into which he had stumbled, was in
the van of that withdrawal.  He made for the door as a
scared rabbit scuttles to its burrow.  Inspector Teal, more
phlegmatically constituted, followed him with less speed
and more self-possession.
</p>

<p>
Kit was the last to go, and he stayed behind for half
a minute.  He went up to Joan and held out his hand.  She
looked up at his face in uncomprehending surprise, and
saw that the hard lines had gone and the flinty glitter was
no longer in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
She put her hand in his, and he gave it a little squeeze.
</p>

<p>
"Kid," he said, "there's a lot of good in you.  And one
hell of a big brick of courage.  I won't preach—I know you'd
hate that.  But you know what I mean."
</p>

<p>
How infinitely sweet and gentle his voice could be!
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry—honest!" said Storm.  "But there's quite a
way to go between saying you're sorry and coming round
with a wreath.  In a very few days the Triangle's going to
smash, and you don't want to be part of the bang.  So don't
be silly.  Get Jimmy away....  Good luck!"
</p>

<p>
From the doorway she watched him stride down the
corridor.  She was conscious of a vague, indescribable
feeling deep within her.  Something that troubled her, that she
could not understand and yet was on the brink of
understanding, seemed to have awakened against her volition.
Something pleasant and yet rather frightening.  Something
that kindled up with the promise of a sweeping flame
... something that had died, was reborn.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Arden!" she called, and he stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo?"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Arden."  Her speech was a little faltering, a
little tremulous.  "You—you're the only busy I've ever met
who was—pure white—all the way through."
</p>

<p>
He smiled and waved his hand cheerily; and then he
turned to the stairs and ran down.
</p>

<p>
He found Teal and Blaythwayt waiting for him in the
street, and the detective had his friend's arm in an
ominously professional grip.
</p>

<p>
"Joe and me," said Teal, oblivious of grammar, "is
going to have words!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope you won't be rude to each other!" said Storm
piously.
</p>

<p>
They walked down Piccadilly together, and they had
almost reached Burlington House when all three of them
saw an amazing sight.
</p>

<p>
Down in Piccadilly Circus, where the statue of Eros
once stood, there flickered into being for an instant a
terrific blinding blaze of violet light.  It seemed to lurch up
from the roadway in one colossal wave of whirling, jagged,
eye-tormenting luminance—a Cyclopean flood of flaring
amethyst which stunned vision and paralysed the brain.  In
a thousandth of a second it was gone, splintering into a
star-searing burst of intolerable dazzling white radiance shot
with zigzagging streaks of orange fire.  And right in the
flash of that fearful disintegration came a shattering,
detonating thunder that rocked the very earth under their
feet and pounded and pulverised the senses into an agony
of quivering helplessness.  And then, on the heels of the
awful reverberation, followed a mighty rushing wind which
reeled them out of all equilibrium and hurled them dazed
and breathless to the ground.

<h3>
CHAPTER XX
<br><br>
MECKLEN IS DISOBEDIENT
</h3>

<p>
On a hot summer night the library of Terry Mannering's
house in Brook Street was a cool alluring room.
</p>

<p>
Susan sat there, cosily stretched out in a deep armchair
placed by an open window.  At the big centre table Terry
was engaged in the arduous task of selecting the probable
winner of the St. Leger; and a litter of sporting journals,
both pink and white, a much-thumbed copy of <i>Racing
Up-to-Date</i>, an open volume of Ruff's <i>Guide to the Turf</i>, and
sheets upon sheets of notepaper covered with abstruse
calculations involving such weird factors as weights, lengths
and seconds—testified to his earnestness.  His wife was
sewing in the chair opposite Susan.  At times Terry would
sit up abruptly and explode into a concentrated malignant
malediction upon every congenital imbecile who ever had,
ever did, or ever intended to essay the unravelling of equine
form; at other moments he would lean back with a resigned
look of martyrdom on his face, heave a long sigh, and
offer a fervent prayer to be caught up to heaven in a fiery
chariot before he reached the stage of dementia where it
would be necessary for him to be hailed to a lunatic
asylum—which anguished vociferations only served to convulse
his audience with unsympathetic hilarity.
</p>

<p>
Susan had been trying to read, but her mind refused to
converge on the printed word.  It kept straggling off into
other channels, and she would recall herself with a start to
find she had skimmed through half a dozen pages without
taking in the meaning of a single line.  At length this
continual absentmindedness forced her to admit that the effort
of literary assimilation was, for that evening at least, a
hopeless failure.  She looked at her watch.  It was nearing
midnight—in spite of her abstraction, the time had flown
past unnoticed—yet she felt in no mood for sleep.  Following
another outbreak of blood-curdling fulmination from
Terry, she laid her book down on her knees, clasped her
hands behind her head, and decided to give her imagination
the rein it was straining for.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts sped instantly to Storm.  She strove to
picture him in her mind's eye, and discovered to her
surprise that she could form only the vaguest possible image.
Little mannerisms of his, his swinging gait, snatches of
his staccato conversation, vivid expressions he had
invented—these were all the material she found to her hand.  The
complete design eluded her.  Even the attempt to visualise
his face resulted only in a mental blur.  Being no
psychologist, this disability irritated and puzzled her.
</p>

<p>
But at least she could remember nearly every word of
their exchange that afternoon, and a soft smile curved her
lips.  Yes, she loved him—loved him with all her heart and
every atom of her being....  But her smile was not of
motherly affection.  (God help the man who inspires that
watery form of love!)  It was a smile of pride, of clean,
wholesome, exuberant joy that he was hers and she his.  He
was so fine, so sunny, so eminently sane and vital, so
masterful—and yet without any artificial, self-conscious,
diluted, drawing-room, flapper-thrilling, synthetic-cavemanishness
about him—so dynamic, so fresh and savoury—both
intellectually and physically....  And she was going
to marry him.  That pride she felt whenever she was
with him was to be hers always....
</p>

<p>
And so, after moments of delicious day-dreaming, her
fantasy carried her reluctantly to his immediate work—the
Alpha Triangle.  When would the menace of that dread
organisation be lifted from the city?  What was the secret
of the Apex, that secret which if broadcast would mean the
lightening of the shadow which loomed over London—the
secret to preserve which the Apex was prepared for
murder?  The thought recalled to her his threat to have her
arrested unless she married him that day.  She had believed at
first that he was joking.  The idea was too preposterous....
And yet, was anything preposterous in those days,
when a gang of killers such as one expects to encounter
only in the pages of the sensational novelist were trying to
blackmail the Centre of the World to the tune of fifteen
million pounds sterling—and were, moreover, almost daily
giving convincing evidence of their mercilessness and their
ability to carry out every threat they made?  But why arrest
her?  The answer was easy: that she might be more efficiently
guarded than she could be in a private house.  And
the alternative, marriage to Storm, would make her nearly
as secure.  But the day he had given her for making up her
mind had gone by, and she had not married him—he had
left the choice open to her as if he expected her to ring him
up and say: "Kit, old man, I've changed my mind.  D'you
think you could spare the time to drop into a registry office
with me this afternoon?"  Everything that was romantic in
her revolted from the cold-bloodedness of the idea.  It was
unthinkable, and yet there had been a substratum of
seriousness underlying his light tone.  What was the second
condition?  "<i>If a certain gentleman now in custody
escapes...</i>"  Of course—but no; even that didn't exceed the bounds
of possibility, when already the Triangle had rescued
thirteen of its members from the Flying Squad van in which
they were being hustled to a police station.  Who was this
man who might escape?  And what was his particular
importance?
</p>

<p>
She had no data for the solution of that problem, and
branched from it on to another tack.
</p>

<p>
Why should she be in danger at all, from any member
of the Triangle?  What did she know, or what had she had
the chance of deducing, which might imperil the secret of
the Apex?  Here at least she had a little knowledge to train
on the question.  She knew some people who were connected
with the mystery: Lord Hannassay, Mattock, Raegenssen,
and—Uncle Joe.  The inclusion of her uncle amused her;
but she left him in the list because he had received one of
the Triangle cards.  Now, what did she know about each?
She took them one by one.  Lord Hannassay?  The Triangle
had murdered him.  She knew little about him, except that
he held a minor position in the Home Office.  Was he
connected with any of the other three? ... The recollection
of his interest in Mattock, to which Storm had attached
some import, came to her in a flash.  She wrestled with the
circumstances of that case.  Mattock had been Hannassay's
secretary, and had forged his employer's name to a cheque;
Hannassay had prosecuted him without mercy, and Mattock
had gone to prison.  Therefore Mattock had a grudge
against Hannassay.  Then how did the others fit in?  She
was certain that Raegenssen belonged somewhere in that
complicated jig-saw—she had a distinct recollection of the
afternoon when the Hirondel had skidded into him.
Raegenssen had been knocked half unconscious, and she had
heard him speak as he was coming round: if he had been
partially stunned, his brain would have functioned without
the restraint which his caution imposed upon it in ordinary
life, and he might have let fall a hint of Something.  And
that Something had had an astounding effect on Storm,
Mattock, and Uncle Joe.  She could even picture their
different expressions—Storm's tense inscrutability, Mattock's
passion, and Uncle Joe's excitement.  What was it
Raegenssen had mumbled?  Some girl's name ... <i>Sylvia</i>!  That
was it.  Then where did Sylvia come in, and who was
Sylvia—why should she have such an incredible influence upon
three men brought together practically by a fluke?
</p>

<p>
Another idea came tapping at Susan's brain.  She could
not quite place it—it was something which hammered at the
doors of her conscious mind and yet just missed gaining
ingress.  A cold wind seemed suddenly to lap her spine,
sending a shiver up her back to the nape of her neck.  She had a
numbing sensation of being on the verge of a bottomless
precipice, of being on the threshold of some terrible
realisation.  There was something enormously significant attached
to that name, and yet it was only a superficial association.  It
wasn't the name itself, but ... but ... but the way it
was said—Raegenssen's voice!
</p>

<p>
For a space the fog that had thwarted her memory rolled
back and blotted out understanding in a maddeningly,
impenetrable vapour of obscurity; and then, through the mist,
dawned a slow nimbus of realisation.  Raegenssen's voice!
Never in her life, she would have sworn, had she spoken
to a man named Raegenssen, and yet the remembered timbre
of his incoherent mutter "<i>Sylvia ... Sylvia ...</i>"
struck a responsive chord which vibrated through her
consciousness with ever-increasing assurance.
</p>

<p>
Conviction came against her will, fighting for expression
against all the massed forces of logic and reasoning.
It was ridiculous, smacking of hallucination, incredible—and
yet, pluck that awakened chord ever so distrustfully,
it rang true every time.  Millimetre by millimetre, battling
doggedly against the overwhelming odds, common sense
gave ground before the onslaught of primeval instinct.  She
was sound of mind and body, had never had cause to doubt
the stability of her senses; therefore, insane as the idea
might seem, it must be granted due audience.  And so, with
every breathless second, that clear, single note of belief sang
in greater and greater volume.  She knew she was right,
knew she could rely on the combined depositions of hearing
and memory ...
</p>

<p>
<i>She knew Raegenssen's voice, and it was the voice of a
man who had spoken to her recently!</i>
</p>

<p>
The full light of understanding blinded her, and her
hands came down suddenly to grip the arms of her chair.
Now that all darkness had been swept away by that last
swift incandescence of knowledge, she was amazed that
she had never seen and gripped that stark fact before.
Perhaps it was because she had not thought to place sufficient
importance on the incident, and therefore had not turned it
over in her mind and inspected it from every angle.
Certainly, circumstances had allied to lull her into accepting
the salient, startling truth as a thing of no account.  Of
course, one may always find a full-grown African rhinoceros
in a soap factory, but the possibility falls short of the
commonly endorsed probabilities of normal life, so that
anyone seeking African rhinoceros heads automatically for
Africa instead of taking his chance in an expedition to Port
Sunlight.  In exactly the same way, her subconscious mind
had so scoffed at the idea of Oscar Raegenssen being no
more than the Mr. Hyde of somebody else's Dr. Jekyll, that
the censor on guard between conscious and subconscious
had barred out the suggestion.  Nevertheless—and, now,
she would have sworn to it—Raegenssen was somebody
else.  Or, conversely, somebody else was Raegenssen.  In
dress, deportment, face and figure there was only the most
far-fetched possible similarity; in the ordinary way, that
difference was likely to extend to voice also; all the same,
there remained one dogmatic heads-I-win-tails-you-lose
certainty by way of bed-rock on which to start rebuilding
every theory about the Alpha Triangle.  And that that
certainly had some very intimate relation to the Triangle was
an assumption which brooked no question.
</p>

<p>
Her head was spinning like a high-pressure dynamo;
the glimpse of infinite leagues of the Unknown which her
new-found wisdom gave her was appalling.  She had a grip
on one salient fact, and she was sure that attached to that
fact was the thread which, properly trailed, would lead to
the centre of the labyrinth.  Whose, then, was that momentous
Voice?  She racked her brain for inspiration; but having
obliged so far, memory baulked at that last fence.  She
realised the difficulty of divorcing voice from all
association of appearance and demeanour.  Storm might have the
various compartments of his reminiscence more efficiently
docketed and cross-indexed than hers were—but how could
one describe a voice?  It seemed hopeless unless one
happened to be an expert imitator, and that ability was not
among her talents.  Still she thought she should get in touch
with him: even while he was on his way she might succeed
in remembering the owner of the Voice.  She had a ludicrous
vision of herself seated in the Chief Commissioner's
room at New Scotland Yard, her head swathed in ice
compresses, what time the heads of the Criminal Investigation
Department hovered and tiptoed around her, waiting in
anxious silence for a clue to fall from her lips ...
</p>

<p>
She smiled to herself, but the impulse to ring up Storm
persisted.  Where would he be at that hour?  Most probably
at his flat, she decided promptly.
</p>

<p>
She was on the point of getting up from her chair to
fetch the telephone, when——
</p>

<p>
BOOM! ... <i>—oom! ... —oom! ...</i>
</p>

<p>
The muffled thunder of a distant explosion came echoing
and reëchoing through the ether.  And not so very distant
either, for the thud of it was louder than anything she had
ever heard—it shook the earth and rattled the windows in
their frames.  She sat up with a jump, and saw that Ann
had dropped her work and was staring about in amazement.
Even Terry looked up with a surprised expression;
and then he leaned heavily on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Concentration!" he breathed reverently.  "What absorption!
What industry!  I hope you're all takin' a lesson from
me.  I'm goin' to register a Deed Poll changing my name to
Rip Van Winkle.  When I started this pestilential job it was
June, and now they're already lettin' off fireworks and
burning the image of Mr. Fawkes.  Still, I suppose to anyone of
my vast intelligence——
</p>

<p>
"Shut up!" commanded his wife rudely.  "Susan, whatever
was it?"
</p>

<p>
"Fireworks, I tell you," said Terry.  "This is the Fifth,
and they're celebratin' Brock's Benefit."
</p>

<p>
And then, stealing through the open windows, from the
east, came the dull roar of a hubbub which swelled with
every minute.  Came, ever so thin and faint, a horrible,
sobbing cry....  The racket grew ... not so very far away
they heard shouts, a screaming babel of police whistles, and
the patter of running feet...
</p>

<p>
Terry moved over to the window and peered out over
their shoulders, but they could see nothing.
</p>

<p>
"Not an air-raid, surely?  Don't say I've slept all through
the Great War, daddy," he murmured, but there was not
much jesting in his manner.
</p>

<p>
They listened.  Windows were being flung open and people
were coming out into the streets.  The shouting had
come nearer—men were spreading the news to everyone
within range of voices, but as yet it was impossible to make
out what was being yelled.  Until, gradually, to the three of
them, came a glimmer of comprehension.  The Triangle.
That ruthless organisation had been abroad again that
night, spreading death and disaster in some terrific fashion
at which for the nonce they could only guess.
</p>

<p>
On the pavement outside the two detectives who guarded
the house were staring into the darkness, speculating about
the cause of the disturbance.
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" Terry called through the window, and
one of them looked up and shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Can't say, sir.  The Triangle threatened to blow up some
places, and Piccadilly Circus was first on the list—the noise
seemed to come from that direction, but I couldn't swear
to it."
</p>

<p>
Storm's flat was near Piccadilly.  A little pang ripped into
Susan's heart, and she caught her breath.  But it wasn't
likely that he'd be in the damage, she reassured herself
doubtfully.  The Albany was some way from Piccadilly
Circus, and London was so big that, even if he were out
that night, it was umpteen thousand to one against his having
been near the explosion.  And, anyhow, it wasn't certain
that Piccadilly Circus had been mined, although logic was
inclined to support that hypothesis....
</p>

<p>
Still they listened, and while they did so a handful of
men and women ran past, laughing, dashing off to "see
the fun."  And then, through the night air, came an ominous
silence, a murmuring stillness which was perplexing until
they realised that it was caused by a sudden stoppage of all
the traffic running on the near south and east.  And through
that hush came a new sound, approaching rapidly.  It
increased, until it could be recognised as the splutter of a
high-powered car tearing through the streets towards them.  As
it sped nearer, it could all but be identified, and the
suspicion it roused made Susan clutch the window sill in
unaccountable terror.  That loud, rising and falling snort and
purr was the voice of a Hirondel—Storm's car.  Was Storm
himself driving?  The fear that It might be carrying his
maimed or lifeless body filled her with a shuddering dread.
</p>

<p>
<i>Was</i> it the Hirondel?  The car broke into sight now, rocking
down the road with its twin headlights ablaze.  It drew
almost abreast of them, and then swerved across the road
and jerked to a standstill before the door with all its brakes
screaming in protest at the rough handling.
</p>

<p>
One of the detectives ran to open the door, and Susan
watched, striving not to flinch, to see who should descend.
</p>

<p>
It was not Storm—-it was a uniformed policeman.  The
man spoke a curt word to the detective, and then ran up
the steps.
</p>

<p>
Susan had the door open for him before he could ring.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" she cried.  "<i>Quick!</i>  Tell me—is he—is
Captain Arden hurt?"
</p>

<p>
The man twiddled a button.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, miss—er—well, not much."  The constable was
confused.  "He's—er—he wants to see you ... and..."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, <i>yes</i>!"  The girl stamped her foot impatiently.  "Go
on.  Tell me the worst—I shan't faint or do anything silly.
Is he—seriously injured?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, miss, you never know," said the policeman
huskily.  "The doctors say—
</p>

<p>
"Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"St. George's Hospital—on his way there, anyhow.  He
sent me to fetch you.  That's his car."
</p>

<p>
"I'll come right away," she said pantingly.  "Hurry!"
</p>

<p>
She could not understand his hesitation, until she turned
and saw Terry and Ann standing behind her.  Terry was
looking grave.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I go with you?" he asked gently, but she shook
her head.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go alone—I'd rather," she said.
</p>

<p>
He nodded understandingly, and she rushed down the
steps and climbed into the car.  The policeman followed.  In
an instant the subdued mutter of the engine had risen to
a deafening roar, and, as the man let in the clutch, the
Hirondel leapt off like an unleashed greyhound,  They
swung into the Park at Grosvenor Gate, and as they
emerged at Hyde Park Corner they saw that, diminished
as the traffic was at that hour, the wreckage of Piccadilly
Circus had caused a block which was already spreading
nearly to Park Lane.  It was with some difficulty that they
threaded their way through the press.
</p>

<p>
To the girl's inquiries the driver answered only in gruff
monosyllables, and she was reduced to picturing to herself
what might have befallen Storm.  It was anguishing to
think of—Storm, the debonair and strong and athletic—now,
perhaps, only a crushed, mutilated travesty of life.  A
quiver of fear touched her lips, and then with a conscious
gesture she tossed her head erect and sat stiffly motionless.
Courage! ... She must have courage....  He had always
so despised cowardice, been so scathingly contemptuous
of people who trembled and shook at the knees and whined
whenever they came up against the toughness and ugliness
of the world.
</p>

<p>
She had hardly noticed their man[oe]uvring through the
gyratory system at the triangular junction of Piccadilly,
Knightsbridge and Grosvenor Place; but the lurch of the
car turning suddenly recalled her to her surroundings.  And
with a shock she realised that they had diverged to the left
and were racing down Constitution Hill with the Hirondel's
cut-out closed down until the engine made no more
than a whispering drone which attracted no attention.
</p>

<p>
She caught at the arm of the uniformed man beside
her.
</p>

<p>
"What's the idea?" she demanded sharply.  "You said
St. George's Hospital——"
</p>

<p>
For answer, his left hand came off the steering-wheel
and his arm whipped behind her shoulders.  His hand came
under her chin, and she felt his thick fingers close upon
her throat.
</p>

<p>
"Never yew worry what I said," hissed Lew Mecklen
in her ear; and, now that he made no attempt to disguise
his voice, his nasal twang shrieked a heart-stopping menace
at her.  "Yew're comin' whar I want yuh, an' ef yew scream
I'll throttle yuh!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI
<br><br>
FOUND DEAD
</h3>

<p>
Storm got to his feet somehow, shaking his head like a
dog that has been for a swim.  He felt sick and giddy, and
the blood was buzzing through his head with the whirr of
a dentist's drill.  The shock had been terrific.  Years ago, in
Flanders, he had gone through the appalling mill of
artillery barrages, intensive bomb-dropping, and the
earthshaking fulguration of tons of H.E. sparked off in land
mines; but he had never even in a nightmare gauged the
possibility of such a stupendous cataclysm as had just taken
place within a quarter of a mile of him.  Comparatively great
as the distance was between himself and the explosion, its
force even at that range had been so daunting that it
seemed miraculous to have survived it.
</p>

<p>
He looked around for the other two, doubtfully, as
though in his bemused condition he hardly expected to
find that the phenomenon had been repeated.  But they,
too, seemed to be unhurt.  Inspector Teal had already
regained his feet and was swaying to and fro with one hand
clasped to his head, muttering white-hot profanities; and
Joe Blaythwayt was sitting up gazing from side to side,
his mouth open and his whole face smudged into one
incredulous gape.  And even while Storm tried to convince
himself that the whole thing wasn't a delusion, Teal staggered
over to the bank manager and held out a hand to
help him rise.
</p>

<p>
Approximately at this time, John Cardan, editor of the
<i>Daily Record</i>, left the offices of that enterprising
newspaper.  He turned into Fleet Street and walked briskly down
towards the Strand, for it was his habit to utilise the space
between Record House and Charing Cross Station, where
he took a late train for his suburban home, to get the
necessary exercise his sedentary occupation denied to him.  And,
as he walked, humming a little song, he was blissfully
unaware of the skulking figure that slunk along behind
him...
</p>

<p>
Birdie was more than a trifle scared.  He did not fully
understand what he was about to do—he could not possibly
have had the foggiest inkling of the volcanic power that
had been compressed into the few drachms of viscous yellow
liquid which swilled about in the tiny phial on which his
fingers rested.  He had about as much chance of appreciating
anything so vast as he had of comprehending the
metaphysical conception of infinity.  All he knew was that
he was carrying a very small quantity of the most powerful
explosive known to science—whatever that might mean.
Thanks to his weedy frame, he had not had the experience
of high explosives which was presented <i>gratis</i> to some
millions of men between the years of 1914 and 1918.  All he
knew about explosives was that they went off with a bang,
and that they couldn't be so very terrible.  Thinking things
over, he was at a loss to account for the fear he had when
his hand first touched that precautionary calorimeter.  No;
what scared Birdie now was the knowledge that he was
about to commit a bigger crime than any in his petty, sneaking
career.  What he thought was that his boss had a grudge
against Cardan, and that the mucid amber in the phial would
simply injure the editor enough to make him sorry for
whatever he had done to the Apex.  Birdie hadn't any idea
what size crime that might be, or how long a stretch he
would get for it if he was caught, but he was sure that it
would be something pretty nasty.
</p>

<p>
Like a furtive shadow he began to quicken his steps so
as to catch up with Cardan.  One hand, resting in his
pocket, held the copper ice-box steady, while his finger and
thumb grasped the slim neck of the phial.  It must be a
quick job, and a quick getaway to follow—be the explosion
ever so small, he was too well known to the splits to risk
being seen loafing anywhere around when the bang happened.
His fingers shook a little, and he strove to hold them
still.  It would be fatal to bungle during the couple of
seconds the bottle would take to flash from the calorimeter to
John Cardan's waistcoat pocket.  By an effort of will he got
his hand back to rock-like firmness and throttled down the
twitching of his nerves, but he could not control the chilly
perspiration which broke out on his palms.
</p>

<p>
Nearer and nearer he drew, his shifty eyes on the alert
for exactly the right combination of circumstances for the
fatal movement.  It came when they had nearly reached the
law Courts—in the shape of three men who were approaching
abreast.  Birdie came level with Cardan at precisely the
right moment, so that for a moment the five of them were
in line, so close together that their shoulders brushed....
</p>

<p>
It was all over in the twinkling of an eye, with just one
lightning flicker of Birdie's slim, trained fingers.  And then
Birdie had ducked down a dark side street and was running
for dear life, gasping painfully with the reaction from
tension.  The copper vessel in his pocket held nothing more
dangerous than some clinking chips of ice.  With a cry
that was rather like a strangled sob, he dragged it out and
flung it far from him, and ran on.
</p>

<p>
And the tiny tube of death reposed in John Cardan's
pocket, the warmth of his body slowly thawing out the oily
fluid to the temperature at which it would detonate....
</p>

<p>
Birdie found himself abruptly faced by a solid brick
wall.  He stopped in horror, and looked around him.  He
had taken the wrong turning—fear had deadened his
judgment—he, who in the pursuit of his craft had long
ago familiarised himself with all the back streets which
would provide a sound prospect of shaking off his pursuers
if he were ever spotted and forced to cut and run.
There was nothing for it; he must retrace his steps, go
back to the vicinity of the Thing!  He hurried through the
darkness, stumbling, panting with apprehension.
</p>

<p>
Birdie had run fast; as he reëntered Fleet Street, he
looked in the direction of the Strand and saw that Cardan
had not gone more than fifty paces.  And while Birdie
looked, the last essential fraction of a degree centigrade
percolated through the thin glass to the charge of nitrogen
trichloride....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Five ghastly seconds later he was racing up Fleet Street,
careless of who saw his headlong flight, reckless of the
inquisitive glance of any busies who might be prowling the
neighbourhood.  His breath came in harsh wheezing groans;
his eyes were dilated with unspeakable terror; in his face
was the ashen pallor of death.  He didn't mind where he
went—he scarcely knew where his feet were taking him.
All that mattered was the placing of leagues and leagues
between himself and the awful thing he had seen; for every
devil and fury from the Pit was shrieking at his heels....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"They've done it!  Blast 'em—they've done it!" said Teal
muzzily.
</p>

<p>
Already people were rushing up towards Piccadilly Circus,
and from Piccadilly Circus itself others were fleeing
in all directions as though expecting a second explosion.
High and shrill above the tumult of shouting came the
scream of a man in mortal agony....
</p>

<p>
Storm set off at a run, Teal lumbered along close behind
him, and Blaythwayt tagged short-windedly in the rear.
Storm covered that quarter-mile in something close to
record time, and Teal was not very far behind when he
fetched up almost on the rim of the huge crater which had
been blown into the heart of the Circus.
</p>

<p>
Ezra Surcon had had a good return from his property in
Great Windmill Street.
</p>

<p>
It was an amazing cavern.  The charge must have been
placed below the deepest Tube cuttings, and experts calculated
that to blast a hole of that size must have taken nearly
five gallons of NCl<sub>3</sub>.  The crater measured roughly fifty
yards across, and in its depths was laid bare the whole
warren of subways that had taken years to construct—there
were even scraps of twisted wreckage from the higher
level lines tangled up among the debris of escalators and
elevators.  Also, the Tube had been open at the time....  People
had been in those subways, had been walking upon the
ground that had been blown away, and omnibuses and cars
had been driving over it....  There were things in that
trough which had once been human, living, sensate....  In it,
too, and around it, were things which had once been living
and were not yet dead....
</p>

<p>
"My God!" muttered Teal hoarsely.  "Why can't they <i>die</i>?"
</p>

<p>
His ruddy face had blenched, and Storm himself had
gone grey under the tan.  The only man who seemed
unaffected was Blaythwayt, who stood a little to one side,
staring about him in wide-eyed curiosity.
</p>

<p>
Already ambulances were careering through the streets
with their right-of-way bells clanging, and constables were
pouring on to the scene to attend to the injured and hold
back the crowd of morbid, pale-faced sightseers.  Storm and
Teal went through the cordon and did what they could for
the sufferers.  It was a horrible and often hopeless task,
but both had had their baptism of blood, and had learned
to steel themselves against sights and sounds which would
have made many men helpless with nausea.
</p>

<p>
Doctors were soon on the scene to help both voluntary
and official workers, and the first two of these that Storm
saw he sent hastening back to fetch hypodermic syringes
and—morphia.  These he commandeered, and then constituted
a panel of himself and their owners.  And when they
saw what he proposed to do, they said nothing.
</p>

<p>
"I shall ask you to give me your opinions on the less
certain cases," he said steadily.  "There are some which you
don't have to be a doc. to diagnose.  I shall give the shot
myself, and I take full responsibility..."
</p>

<p>
It was an hour before all the human scath which could
ever hope to live had been removed in the ambulances, and
the dead decently laid out.
</p>

<p>
Storm was weary of body and soul by that time, and
when he found Inspector Teal he saw that, husky as the
detective was, he was in no better case.
</p>

<p>
"I've killed seven men to-night," said Storm heavily.
"It was God's blessing to 'em.  But I'm—sick!  This is worse
than war."
</p>

<p>
Teal was silent.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"What do we do now, Chief?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Go home, I suppose.  We can't do any more here.  Where's
Joe?"
</p>

<p>
"Somewhere round—I saw him lending a hand with the
best of 'em, soon as he'd got over rubbering.  He's taken it
better than either of us.  He must have nerves of ice!"
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt came up at that moment, wiping his hands
on a stained handkerchief.  He was still round-eyed with
interest; but otherwise, except for an excusable excitement,
he was remarkably self-possessed.
</p>

<p>
"An Extraordinary Experience!" he said.  "Of course,
one's very sorry for all those poor wretches; but still..."
</p>

<p>
He broke off with a shrug, as though to imply that the
scientific mind transcended such mundane considerations.
</p>

<p>
"I ought to drop in at the Yard," Teal said with a sigh.
"You've got an advantage over me, Captain Arden—you're
not a regular and you don't have to bother so much about
routine."  He yawned.  "Lordy!  I seem to average about ten
minutes' sleep per night these days," he complained
somewhat paradoxically.
</p>

<p>
"You'll average less for the next seventy hours or so!"
Storm told him.  "I'll come with you—I might find the
Commissioner in."
</p>

<p>
Joe Blaythwayt was skipping eagerly in front of them.
</p>

<p>
"D'you think I could come too?" he pleaded wistfully.
"I've never had a chance to see inside Scotland Yard, and
after what's happened to-night it seems as if my Luck Is
In—I don't mean to be callous," he excused himself
incoherently.  "I'm sorry, as I said, but——"
</p>

<p>
Teal shook an admonishing finger at him.
</p>

<p>
"Joe, you go home to bed," he commanded sternly.
"You're a bloodthirsty little man, and I think you've had
all the horrors that's good for you to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, let him come," Storm interrupted wearily.  "What
the devil does it matter, anyway?"
</p>

<p>
They found a taxi in Trafalgar Square and piled in.  Joe
Blaythwayt, still clasping his umbrella, which somehow he
had managed to retain throughout the proceedings, was all
agog with anticipation.  Decidedly, one would have thought,
he regarded it as His Evening.
</p>

<p>
Storm was less cheerful.
</p>

<p>
"The hell of it is that I feel responsible," he explained
bitterly.  "I deliberately let the Triangle get away, and now
he's made to-night's mess.  Selfishness—or quixoticism, if
you like—I don't know.  Listen, Teal, and I'll tell you
something!  I've known the Triangle for days, but I wasn't
going to show him up in the usual way, as I told the Inquiry,
for the reason you know."
</p>

<p>
"You know the Triangle?" broke in Teal incredulously.
"I thought that was a bluff you put up for the Board."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know him.  I'll tell you what my idea was.  I'm
a fool, maybe, but because he's my father I didn't want any
publicity.  And by the same token, I couldn't very well kill
him myself.  So what I intended to do was collect so much
evidence that I could go to him and lay it before him so
definitely he'd see the only alternative to hanging
was—suicide.  I know what his choice'd have been."
</p>

<p>
"Have you got that evidence now?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Storm bitterly, and was silent all the rest
of the way to Cannon Row.
</p>

<p>
They left Blaythwayt in charge of the reserve sergeant
and went up to the Commissioner's room.  Smethurst was
away, but they had not been there five minutes before Bill
Kennedy came in for first-hand news of the Piccadilly
Circus explosion.  Storm left Teal to give the account, and
himself went over to the window and sat down on the sill,
smoking a cigarette.
</p>

<p>
Storm's face was chiselled out into grim lines, but behind
its inscrutability and actuating the leisurely precision of
his movements was a hurtling mill of mental concentration.
What was the next move to be?  He strove to grapple with
the problem, but his over-tired brain refused to function
with the methodical accuracy he demanded of it.  Teal had
complained of the curtailment of the hours of slumber,
but Storm himself had had little sleep that last week, and
mind is not tireless like machinery.  Yet he kept on, keying
his already taut faculties almost up to snapping pitch,
calling up all his reserves of energy, and struggling with their
aid to outline a practical plan.
</p>

<p>
Teal had just finished his account when the telephone
rang.  Storm, who was nearest, took the call.
</p>

<p>
It was the City Commissioner speaking.
</p>

<p>
"You've had a blow-up in Piccadilly Circus, haven't
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh—er—yes!  I believe we have!" said Storm ironically,
and the Commissioner snorted in disgust.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've had a smaller one in Fleet Street.  Just one
man—blown to crumbs.  There's no hope of identifying him.
I just thought you might be interested.  Sands, a pickpocket
belonging to the Walton Street manor, was seen haring
away from the scene as if he'd a big scare, so you might
put out a call for him."
</p>

<p>
"I will.  Fleet Street, I think you said?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Uh-huh.  The dead man is John Cardan, editor of the
<i>Daily Record</i>," said Storm calmly, and hung up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
After what had happened that night, such minor details
as solo murders seemed things of no account.  Storm had
reached the stage where he was beyond the reach of agitation.
</p>

<p>
He gave the Assistant Commissioner a brief account of
the conversation, and he was still speaking when the
telephone bell shrilled again.  This time it was the Thames
Police depot on Victoria Embankment.
</p>

<p>
When Storm put down the instrument a queer flush had
come into his face.
</p>

<p>
"A body's been taken out of the river," he said slowly.
"Head smashed to pulp with an axe.  The tailor's tab in the
breast pocket, and some papers in the clothes, say that it's
Oscar.  I guess this is the end of the world!"
</p>

<p>
Storm and Teal went off to view the corpse, and the
detective was surprised to see that Storm hailed a taxi in
Cannon Row instead of setting out to walk the short
distance along the Embankment.  Mr. Teal, however, was too
well trained to make any demur, and he had just got in
when Blaythwayt came rushing up.
</p>

<p>
The bank manager climbed in as the taxi started off,
and sat down beaming.  The other two let him stay—it was
amazing what a fixture that plump little man had become
that night.  In normal times he would probably have been
unceremoniously ejected, but both Storm and Teal were
too tired and too occupied with other matters to take the
trouble of arguing him home.
</p>

<p>
The taxi drove to a house in Harley Street, and Storm
had to ring for some time before he could get an answer.
At length a dishevelled butler swathed in a grey flannel
dressing-gown over lamentably striped pyjamas opened the
door.  When he had heard Kit's business, he began to shut
the door again, but Storm kicked it wide and entered the
hall.  A moment later the Home Office pathologist, himself
awakened by the noise, appeared at the head of the stairs
and inquired sleepily but with some mastery of expletive,
what it all meant.
</p>

<p>
Storm presented his credentials.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry to turn you out at this ungodly hour, but it's
very important.  I may not need you at all, but there's a big
possibility that I may, and if I want you I shall want you
at once!"
</p>

<p>
"All right," said the doctor peevishly.  "I suppose it's
all in the night's work.  The butler'll give you a drink while
I'm dressing."
</p>

<p>
He was down in an astonishingly short time, and the four
of them entered the taxi.  The pathologist seemed surprised
to see Blaythwayt, and Teal was in a quandary until an
idea seized him.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Blaythwayt is Raegenssen's banker," he explained.
"He's going to identify the body."
</p>

<p>
Joe stood by while the sheet that shrouded the dead man
was removed, and then peered interestedly into the battered
face.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't swear to it," he said at last.  "But I think it's
he—that yellow beard of his is so distinctive."
</p>

<p>
"That's half the trouble," remarked Storm cryptically.
</p>

<p>
Blaythwayt was then shown the clothes that had been
worn by the body, and these he declared without hesitation
to be Raegenssen's.  Apparently the Swede had possessed
only one lounge suit, for Blaythwayt said that the
garments were those which Raegenssen had been wearing
whenever his banker had seen him.
</p>

<p>
Storm turned to the pathologist.
</p>

<p>
"Set up the gadgets!" he ordered curtly, and the doctor,
after a glance of surprise, began to unpack the large
black bag he had brought with him at Storm's request.
</p>

<p>
In the small room, besides Teal and Blaythwayt, was
also a sergeant of the Thames Police, and to these three
Storm addressed his next command.
</p>

<p>
"There's to be no dispute about this," he said, "so to
make everything trebly sure you'll all do your bit.  I want
each of you to take two hairs from Raegenssen's beard, and
lay them on the sheet of paper Dr. Malleson has laid out
for them."
</p>

<p>
Wondering, they obeyed.
</p>

<p>
"Now stand by while Dr. Malleson makes his tests."
</p>

<p>
The pathologist bent to his work, while they waited in
a mystified silence.  It was half-an-hour before he straightened
his back with a sigh and indicated that he was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"Well?" asked Storm, and Malleson looked at him curiously.
</p>

<p>
"Peroxide," he replied.  "The hair was originally black,
and I should say that it was the hair of one of the more
southern races—several Spaniards and Portuguese are
diluted with Moorish blood.  What made you suspect bleaching?"
</p>

<p>
But this was a question that Storm was not for the moment
disposed to answer.  As a matter of fact, all that he had
suspected was that the body was not Raegenssen's, and
the rarity of beards of that Nordic hue was great enough to
arouse the suspicion that a black-bearded man would have
had to be found and disguised in order to provide a substitute.
</p>

<p>
He led the way into the office, and a combined deposition
was made out and signed.  It was an interesting document.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="letter">
We, the undersigned, do hereby attest and swear that at
1.30 a.m. this morning we did, in the presence of each other
and of the undersigned Dr. Malleson, pathologist to the Home
Office, and Captain Arden, temporarily attached to the Special
Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department, remove
from the beard of a cadaver taken from the Thames last night
and so far presumed to be that of Oscar Raegenssen, agent, of
Cockspur Street, S.W.1, each of us two hairs; and, further,
that the said Dr. Malleson made the examination of these hairs,
which is the subject of his appended affidavit in our presence.

And I, Soames Malleson, pathologist to the Home Office, do
hereby attest and swear that in the presence of the above-named
witnesses I did examine the said beard hairs, and did
find that they were the hairs of a dark-complexioned man
which had been bleached with peroxide of hydrogen to give a
similitude of fairness.  I further add that, from an inspection of
other body hairs of the deceased, and from such cranial
characteristics as can be observed, my sworn opinion is that the
deceased was not Scandinavian, but of the Latin type, and
probably of Moorish extraction.

</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"That's simply for the official record," Storm said as he
blotted his signature.  "I want a copy for my own use, also
signed by all of you."
</p>

<p>
When the facsimile had been made out and witnessed, he
went back to make a fresh inspection of the clothes that
had been taken from Raegenssen's body.  This time he
made an interesting discovery, for a more careful search
of the coat revealed that there were some papers sewn into
the lining.  Storm slit the silk with his penknife and drew
them out—four photographs.
</p>

<p>
For a while he stared at them, standing as if he were
carven out of granite.  Every face that was there he knew,
and the realisation that he had stumbled upon the last secret
of the Alpha Triangle thundered through his head like
the roar of a cataract.
</p>

<p>
"Je-rusalem!" he breathed.
</p>

<p>
At one stroke all the handicaps that had been piling up
ever since the disappearance of Raegenssen, and that had
culminated in the Piccadilly explosion that night, were
swept away.  Just by that one slip.  The body which lay
stiffly stretched out on the stone slab was not Raegenssen—was
not even the man who had impersonated Raegenssen—but
it was simply the corpse of an unknown man of
similar height and build, and similarly bearded, with his
hair and beard bleached to the likeness of Raegenssen's
Viking crop and Raegenssen's clothes upon him to assist
the identification which the terrible mutilation of the
features prevented.  And, in putting his clothes upon his
substitute corpse, Raegenssen must have overlooked those
photographs stitched for safety into the lining.  For the third
photograph was the face of a man whom Storm knew
well by sight, and had also known to be associated with the
Triangle—but never had he dreamed that that man was
none other than the Triangle himself!  The other two—and
Raegenssen was one of them—were mere effigies, shadows,
puppets that danced to the bidding of the Apex and served
to screen his own importance; but the third man was the
Apex, the keystone upon which the whole edifice depended....
</p>

<p>
Storm became aware that someone was breathing down
his neck, and swung round sharply.  It was Joe Blaythwayt,
his cherubic pink face gone livid, his baby blue eyes almost
popping out of his head.
</p>

<p>
Storm stepped pointedly away from the banker, and a
crestfallen Joe resumed the nibbling of his umbrella
handle.  Kit put the three photographs together and buttoned
them into the safety pocket on the inside of his waistcoat;
and as he did so the fourth fell from his hand.
</p>

<p>
Teal picked it up and glanced at it before restoring it
to his chief.  It was the picture of a girl of about twenty,
and even the hideous Victorian high-necked, leg-o'-mutton-sleeved
blouse she wore and the ugly, old-fashioned arrangement
of her fair hair could not disguise her striking loveliness.
Even the impassive detective drew in his breath with
a quick hiss of admiration.  And then Storm gently took
the print from him and put it away in his wallet.
</p>

<p>
"Who was that?" asked Teal.
</p>

<p>
Kit looked him straight in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That," he said evenly, "was Sylvia Mattock—my mother!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII
<br><br>
STORM GOES GUNNING
</h3>

<p>
It was not until they were about to leave the Thames
Police Station that the absence of Blaythwayt was noticed.
The little man, after being detected in the act of prying
over Storm's shoulder, had faded self-consciously into the
background; and, from that obscure retirement, he seemed
to have sunk through the floor or dissipated into air.
Certainly he had subsided completely out of the tableau, and
Teal scratched his head in perplexity; for it was not to be
expected that Joe, having at last succeeded in getting his
nose on to an official scent, would make for home and a
comfortable bed with a feeling of sensatory repletion.  There
is no bloodhound so hot and indefatigable on a trail as your
enthusiastic amateur, whether he be a collector of postage-stamps
or particularly gory murders, and the evanescence
of Uncle Joe in those circumstances was provocative of
thought.
</p>

<p>
"I only hope the little goop hasn't gone off to try and
pinch the Apex himself," said Teal gloomily; but, knowing
the sensational leanings of his friend, he was none too easy
in his mind on that score.
</p>

<p>
No one was to know that, even as Teal voiced his prayer,
an asthmatic and flustered Joe Blaythwayt was panting out
instructions to a taxi-driver and scrambling into the cab to
be driven swiftly westwards....
</p>

<p>
"Never mind Uncle Joe," advised Storm.  "I guess he'll
keep—and he's old enough to be loosed off without a
chaperon."
</p>

<p>
They saw Malleson off in a taxi, and then hailed a second
cab for themselves.  Storm, nearly worn out, was making
for the Albany and a long overdue rest; and Teal,
beguiled by the promise of a strong nightcap, accompanied
him.  They hardly spoke on the drive back, for each was
busy with his own thoughts.  Teal's, it may be said, mostly
ended in question marks, but nevertheless the detective had
acquired a number of facts that night which opened up
a maze of speculations and startling possibilities.  As for
Storm, he was wondering vaguely if he would get any sleep
at all from then on until the Triangle had ceased to be—so
far-reaching were the results of his investigations over
the last two hours.  His head still throbbed painfully from
the concussion of the Piccadilly Circus explosion, but his
mind had taken unto itself a new lease of energy.  Everything
had clarified suddenly, partly through the stimulus
of those four photographs, partly because excessive weariness
was already entering upon a reaction—that reaction
which takes one to a quality approaching brilliance, when
the whole body has become so tired that there are no
restraints whatever upon the heights which may be attained
by the feverishly soaring brain; a reaction which is very
short and transitory, and which is followed by a long period
of even greater lassitude than that which led up to it.
</p>

<p>
The taxi stopped in Piccadilly outside Albany Court
Yard, and they got out.  Storm paid off the driver, and, as
the cab drove off, went after Teal, who had gone on ahead.
</p>

<p>
Teal was at the foot of the Albany steps, and Storm was
well inside the Court, before either of them noticed an
extraordinary thing.  It was very dark, for the electric light
mains had been wrecked by the land mine, and one almost
had to grope one's way along, foot by foot.  And then the
moon came out from behind a bank of cloud and drenched
everything under its eye in a flood of nebulous silver light,
and Storm yelled a warning to Teal which made that slothful
man spin round with the agility of an antelope.
</p>

<p>
<i>The deep shadows cast by the three walls of the Court
were alive with men!</i>
</p>

<p>
Teal took in the situation at a glance.  In a fraction of
a second he had leapt up the steps, obeying Storm's shouted
command, and as he sprang he jerked his automatic from
his pocket.  In those days, Storm did not rely upon one
gun—he carried two, and both of them were in his hands now.
</p>

<p>
The promise of action had driven the last vestige of
sluggishness from Arden's brain, and almost without
conscious thought he had remembered the words of the Era
advertisement and the orders of the Apex given over the
loud-speaking telephone that night.  Teal was to be killed, and
he, Storm, was merely to be captured.  Therefore Storm
had roared to Teal to make for cover and not stop to give
battle; and Teal, being a law-enforcing machine whose
first instinct was obedience, had obeyed automatically before
he even grasped the significance of the order.
</p>

<p>
<i>Crack!...  Crack!...</i>
</p>

<p>
The enemy fired the first shots, and the din double-echoed
resonantly in the confined space.  Storm retaliated with one
gun at each of the two flashes he saw, and a yelp of pain
told him that at least one of his bullets had found asylum.
Teal had halted at the top of the steps, and his gun blazed
back at a third flash which barked in the echo of Storm's
twin reprisal.  By then, the detective's intelligence had made
itself heard above the commands of discipline, and Teal was
not the man to run away from a fight to save his precious
skin and leave another man to face the music.
</p>

<p>
Teal's stance was simply asking for trouble.  He stood
exactly in the right place for the moonshine to pick him
out as a beautifully illuminated target.  Storm saw the
danger and yelled another order as he raced across to join the
detective.  But the smell of battle and the sight of those
sinister shadows closing in upon his chief had made Teal
go pig-headed, and he stood his ground obstinately.
</p>

<p>
In Piccadilly a police whistle screamed.
</p>

<p>
Teal fired again into the murky shapes which rushed
upon Storm from all directions.  And then one of the shapes
turned its course and shot back twice at the detective.  Storm
saw Teal stagger and go down.
</p>

<p>
An instant later Storm himself had other things to think
of.
</p>

<p>
There must have been fully thirty men lying in ambush
along those treacherous patches of blackness.  The odds
were hopeless.  When he started running, Storm had been
making for the Albany entrance; but there had been men
hidden in the darkness on either side of the steps, and now
these barred his way and their fellows hemmed his retreat
via Albany Court Yard.  There was only one horse to back.
The fact that all the shooting had been aimed at Teal
seemed to indicate that the order not to kill Kit still applied.
Storm's only chance, then, was to bank on the men obeying
orders and try to put the fear of God into them with merciless
gunning from his own quarter.  Storm took that chance.
His two automatics rattled like machine-gun fire, and he
saw one after another of the men in front of him go down
before that leaden scythe until he had cut a lane through
the blockade.  Others were already closing in to fill the places
of the fallen, but, running like a sprint champion, there
might be a thin hope of breaking through before they could
take up position.
</p>

<p>
What Storm hadn't—couldn't have—allowed for was the
fact that there must always be men behind him.  Therefore
he didn't see the arms of the two men behind him swing
up, didn't see the two skilfully-thrown sandbags hurtle
through the air—only felt the dull, sickening impact of
something heavy and yet yielding upon the back of his neck,
before he crashed to the ground and everything vanished
in a whirling infinity of blackness....
</p>

<p>
He came to on a sofa, with his head throbbing horribly,
and his first surprise was to find that he was in his own
flat.  The second was the presence of a man he knew, who
was binding up an ugly wound in Teal's shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Terry!" called Storm.  "How did you get here?"
</p>

<p>
Terry Mannering looked up and smiled, but the haggardness
of that ordinarily cheerful young man made the grin
unconvincing.
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, brother.  You sit tight for a bit and
get the bump off your cranium.  Havin' a solid ivory skull,
you're still livin' when by all rights you ought to be
dead—in a large experience of sandbaggin' and divers kindred
sports, I may say I've never——"
</p>

<p>
"Cut out the bedside manner, Terry, for the love of
Mud!" snarled Storm weakly.  "What's happened?"
</p>

<p>
He tried to sit up, and had to make several attempts
before he could overcome the sick giddiness that the effort
caused.  Terry went on bandaging Teal, and tried to infuse
flippancy into his tone as he gave the account.
</p>

<p>
"Havin' missed our tame policeman," he said, "the Triangle
coves had rather come a mucker.  Far as we can make
out, the idea was to pip Teal first bang an' then grab you
in the same bar, so to speak.  Unfortunately, you two
warriors put up such a scrap an' made such a row about it that
half the Roberts in London were chargin' on to the field
before you'd been downed and outed as per invoice.  Therefore,
realisin' that dispersion is occasionally the better part
of valour, your adorin' playmates legged it through the
Albany an' out the other side, where the Roberts ceased
from troublin' an' the policemen were at rest.  They got
away, leavin' your bodies on the plain an' a number of
short-winded bobbies pantin' in their wake.  Really, you
know, you want to enlist a few Olympic runners in your
comic copper battalions, if you want to catch young Pegasi
(or is it Pegasuses?) like our friends——"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, cut it out!" snapped Storm.  "What brought you here?"
</p>

<p>
Terry gave the finishing touches to Teal's bandages, and
then left the detective to put on his coat and himself lighted
a long cigar and puffed thoughtfully.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you'll have to know," he murmured at length.
"Though, as a qualified physician whose disgustin' wealth
has stopped him from practising I'll warn you that if you
go dashin' off doin' anythin' silly you'll be knocked up for
weeks.  Well, to put it briefly, at home we thought you'd
been knocked out in the firework display.  An' Susan
thought so too.  You were on your way to St. George's
Hospital, and had very kindly sent your 'bus round to bring the
chief mourners to your deathbed.  A uniformed Robert was
drivin', so everything in the garden looked lovely—barrin',
of course, your own impendin' demise..."  Terry studied
the end of his cigar intently.  "D'you get me, little one?"
</p>

<p>
Storm sat still for some seconds.  He might have been
graven in bronze for all the emotion he displayed; and yet,
behind that mechanical masquerade, he was suffering the
tortures of the damned....  Susan, his Susan ... in the
Power of the Dog....  "<i>Kill H...</i>"  At that moment, for
the first time in his life, he knew the meaning of utter
hopelessness.  Nothing mattered in the whole world, nothing
existed but that hideous fact.  The Triangle might blast
London off the face of the earth, might blow to atoms a
thousand more John Cardans—it wouldn't count a lonely
Continental cuss.  Susan was gone....  The only ray of hope
came from the implied assertion that she'd been kidnapped
instead of murdered on the spot, and even that knowledge
was fraught with fears too horrible to contemplate....
</p>

<p>
Put into the balance in Storm's favour that in the last
seventy-two hours he had had less than seven hours' sleep,
and perhaps you will understand and forgive him for plumbing
such abysses of despair.  And that spineless despondency
was only momentary.  Before it could consolidate the
position it had gained, Storm hurled up every supporting mote
of fighting weight that was in him to hold the breach.  With
a clinched effort of will which racked and locked his nerves
in positive physical anguish he focused all his strength upon
the one object of getting his mind and body back to par.
His face remained inscrutable and all his muscles were
relaxed, but the sweat broke out in glistening gouts on his
forehead.  And, gradually, inch by painful inch, he scourged
himself into cool, calm reason.  Watching him, few would
have known that in the fleeting of those few seconds he had
gone down into Inferno and dragged himself back again
into the world.
</p>

<p>
Storm raised his eyes.  His hand went slowly to his
pocket and drew out his cigarette-case.  With leisured care
he selected a cigarette, tapped it on his thumb-nail, and put
it between his lips.  Still with the same Alpine steadiness,
he took a box of matches from his pocket, struck a light, and
held it to the cigarette.  He extinguished the match with one
flourishing sweep of his hand and broke it into little tiny
splinters, dropping them one by one on to the carpet.  And
then, sitting with his elbows on his knees and his hands
cupped boyishly under his chin, he took the cigarette from
his mouth and blew out a long blue trail of smoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes?" he prompted, and his voice was as coldly level as
a frozen tarn.
</p>

<p>
Terry fastidiously preserved the cone of ash that was
accumulating on his cigar.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I offered to go with Susan, but she wanted to go
alone.  Still, I'd gathered from the Robert's not very snappy
backchat that you were more or less lyin' on the banks of
the Styx waitin' for the ferry; so, for the sake of old
times, after allowin' Susan half an hour's start to get
through the last fond farewell"—Terry grinned wryly—"I
tottered along myself.  Had the jolly old Sisters of Mercy
heard of Captain Arden?  They had not.  Had the worthy
chirurgeons?  <i>Non plus</i>.  I combed every ward myself, and
when we hadn't located you I remembered the Triangle's
interest in Susan and began to get a whiff of <i>Mus
decumanus</i>, or the common rat.  Toddlin' round to Scotland
Yard, I was told you'd just left on a morgue tour along the
Embankment.  So I came toolin' on here to wait for you.
<i>Et voila!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Storm.  "Can you get me some real
eighty-over-proof dope?  Snow for preference.  I'm about done in,
and my acquaintance with rest cures looks like being not
yet."
</p>

<p>
Terry looked at him for a moment, and then nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I'll knock up a chemist myself," he promised.  "But
you'll try to get some sleep, won't you?  Tumblin' into the
arms of Morpheus, and so forth?"
</p>

<p>
Kit nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I can't do anything to-night, but God knows what I'll
feel like to-morrow.  I won't use the stuff if I can help it,
but I want it for a stand-by.  Push off now like a good
fellow, and get Teal home right afterwards, will you?"
</p>

<p>
Terry went, and then Storm crossed to the telephone and
called Scotland Yard.  He was lucky enough to find the
Assistant Commissioner still there.
</p>

<p>
"I want Prester John," said Storm.  "Get him to my
flat by nine to-morrow if it's humanly possible.  And Birdie,
if they can find him.  Have men out after the two of 'em
all night, and hogshave all search warrants!  Also Snooper
Brome—add him to the list.  Got me?"
</p>

<p>
Then Storm went wearily to his bedroom.  He wound
his alarm clock and set the bell at 8.30; and then, only
removing his coat, collar and tie, he fell into bed and was
almost instantly asleep.
</p>

<p>
The buzzer awakened him after an all too short rest, and
his first impulse was to shut the darn thing off, turn over,
and sink back into the delicious Nirvana from which its
clarion call had roused him.  And then he remembered
everything....  With a sigh he flung off the sheet and got up.
His head ached appallingly, and for some unknown reason
he was stiff in every limb.  He undressed and made for the
bathroom, and under the invigorating chill of a cold needle
spray a good deal of the muzziness cleared away.  A brisk
rub down restored him still more; and, so great were the
recuperative powers of his robust health, he finished dressing
again with the feeling of being little the worse for the
strain he had been through.  A slight thickheadedness and
a heaviness in the eyelids—that was all.
</p>

<p>
He burst into the sitting-room to be greeted by the
yawning visage of Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
"Je-rusalem!" he said.  "What're you about so early
for?"
</p>

<p>
"I haven't been away," replied Teal, stretching his sound
arm.  "Your sofa's pretty comfortable, and I don't like being
sent behind the lines when there's anything doing on the
front."
</p>

<p>
Storm turned to his manservant, who was laying the
table for breakfast.
</p>

<p>
"We'll start with a double Colonial breakfast," he said
briskly.  "And make your coffee black and strong!"
</p>

<p>
He was gulping a Horse's Neck into whose composition
very little ginger ale had entered when the Assistant
Commissioner arrived.
</p>

<p>
Bill Kennedy was alone, and the scowl which invariably
disfigured his face before breakfast was more worried than
usual.
</p>

<p>
"I haven't got either of your men," he confessed bluntly.
"Prester John's left the country to make a new start in
Canada, and Brome's vanished.  We never knew much about
Snooper, anyhow, and the lag who runs his fencing store
in Kensington when Eddie's away hasn't seen him for
days.  What's the particular hurry?"
</p>

<p>
Storm told him in four words, and then—
</p>

<p>
"Did Mr. Mannering turn in that dope, Teal?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
For answer, Teal pointed to the cellarette, and Storm
went over and opened the small parcel which lay there.  He
took a glance at the hypodermic syringe it contained, and
the two phials packed into the metal syringe-case, and
slipped the box into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
He carried writing materials over to the breakfast table
and wrote while he made his meal.  When he had finished
there were five closely written pages which he checked over
carefully and then sealed into an envelope, scribbling his
initials on the flap.
</p>

<p>
He gave the package to Bill Kennedy.
</p>

<p>
"I put you on your honour not to open this unless I fail
to report at the Yard by midnight," he said.  "It gives you
the identity of the Triangle and a string of substantial
evidence against him—enough to hang an army!  If I don't
turn up you'll know what to do.  Secondly, I'll bet you've
had men put on to guard me after last night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  Bill nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Take 'em off right now!  Bill, I guarantee that if I see
anyone that looks like a nursemaid in trousers tailing me
around when I leave here I'll wring his neck!  I <i>want</i> the
Triangle to catch me—that's the only chance I've got left
of cleaning up this mess outside of the Old Bailey.  You put
that right up inside the big bone you wear under your hat,
and let it dig itself in!"
</p>

<p>
Even as he spoke Storm was stripping off his coat and
shirt, and they had a chance to view his magnificent torso.
The muscle just lay on him in slabs, writhing and cording
under the satiny skin with every movement he made.  He
was ribbed out and sinewed up like a thoroughbred
racehorse—he might have served as a model for a statue of
Apollo, with his perfectly proportioned, splendidly supple
and yet immensely powerful development.  Storm was always
trained to a hair; and, at that moment, as he stretched
and limbered up, he looked fit to fight for a kingdom
... whereas he was going to fight for something which, to him,
meant more than all the cities of the world and their
glory——
</p>

<p>
He disappeared into his bedroom and returned a minute
later with a heavy bundle in his arms.
</p>

<p>
Against each bicep, by means of straps fastened above
and below the muscle, he fixed neat leather holsters which
carried compact small-calibre automatics.  Against his right
calf he laid a small thin razor-sharp poignard which was
held in place by his sock and sock suspender.  Thus secretly
armed, he pulled over his head a jerkin of pliant deerskin
which laced up to the collar-bone; and over this he put on a
singlet of the finest steel mesh.
</p>

<p>
Kennedy and Teal observed all these accoutrements
with unconcealed interest, and Storm smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Courage gets medals," he remarked as he resumed his
shirt, "but people who sail into typhoons without taking
in canvas, battening all hatches, and rigging life-lines, just
get what they deserve—and that's Hell!"
</p>

<p>
He completed his reclothing, slipped another automatic—to
be found if and when he was searched—into his
hip-pocket, lighted a cigarette, and picked up his hat.
</p>

<p>
"So far I've been the world's premier boob," he said—"the
most paralytic fall-guy that ever wore pants.  And I'm
going to get even or bust!"
</p>

<p>
He was in high spirits.  In spite of the ever-present fear
for Susan which haunted the back of his mind, he was
totally unable to repress his cheerfulness.  The scent of
battle always got him that way; and it was a trait of his which
caused him great annoyance, for, when sparring and
waiting about turned the corner into the straight run home
of action, breathless and perilous, he seemed incapable of
seeing things in their true values.  But this callousness was
only superficial.  The real fact was that a high incentive
whetted and honed the edge of his deep-rooted fighting
instinct, making it seem predominant.
</p>

<p>
"Where're you going?" asked Bill Kennedy.
</p>

<p>
Storm paused at the door, and a reckless smile, reminiscent
of the Viking warrior whose idea of heaven was a
Valhalla where daily warfare provided eternal bliss, touched
his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Looking for trouble!" he said grimly.  "And I think
it's coming good and fast!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII
<br><br>
PANIC OF BIRDIE
</h3>

<p>
Susan sat quite still.  The tension of Mecklen's fingers
about her throat and the ferocious look on his face left
her in no doubt but that he would carry out his threat if
she gave him the ghost of an excuse.  Besides, Susan wasn't
the sort to go into hysterics when yammering for help
didn't offer any reasonable hope of help being forthcoming.
There were a few pedestrians about and not another
car in sight—anyway, even if she did shout, and were
heard, her would-be rescuers would have about as much
chance of stopping that flying Hirondel as they would have
of hopping over the Woolworth Building.
</p>

<p>
"You needn't get excited," she said coldly.  "I haven't
screamed since they took me out of long clothes."
</p>

<p>
Mecklen said nothing.  Still retaining that menacing grip
on her windpipe, he was hunched up over the steering wheel
with his eyes glued to the road in front, pushing the car
along as fast as he dared.
</p>

<p>
"You can take your hands off," Susan added.  "Someone
might see us, and"—she groped about in her vocabulary
of American for a phrase the Bowery boy might
understand—"I don't want to be mistaken for the Sheba of a
roughneck like you.  I promise not to yell."
</p>

<p>
Lew hesitated, and then withdrew his arm—not because
her gibe cut any ice with him, but because he'd remembered
his uniform and didn't want to make himself conspicuous
if anyone <i>should</i> happen to see them.  Tough-looking
policemen don't as a rule drive round in expensive cars with their
arms round the necks of fashionably dressed girls; and
Mecklen realised that he'd left enough tracks behind him
already that night without adding to the number.
</p>

<p>
"Yew'd better not squawk," he assured her, to make it
plain that he released her for his own reasons and not
because of her command.
</p>

<p>
They swung round the Victoria Memorial and entered
Buckingham Gate.  The car ran down the deserted
thoroughfare and tacked down a side street on the left and
left again into a dark mews.
</p>

<p>
Mecklen stopped the car and took Susan's arm in a
vise-like grasp.
</p>

<p>
"Git outa here," he ordered.  "An' jest yew see yew don't
fergit wot I told yuh.  One yap, an' yew git yores."
</p>

<p>
She got down from the car, and he followed her.  In the
darkness he shifted his clutch to her left arm, and she felt
something prick her breast, and saw the dull shimmer of
steel.
</p>

<p>
"Jest a <i>ree</i>minder," he said.  "Move!"
</p>

<p>
He unlocked a garage door and pulled her inside.  She
heard two bolts clang into place behind them, and then a
switch clicked down and the place was dimly illuminated.
She saw that what had seemed to be one solitary lock-up was
in reality a huge garage which ran the whole length of that
side of the mews behind the other dummy doors.  Stored in
it was a wonderful collection of motors—two aluminium-finished
racing cars, four Rossleigh trucks, a Navarre
limousine, a Carillon cabriolet, and one black closed-in van
which she could not identify although something about it
was vaguely familiar.  And the noticeable fact about the
collection was that none of them carried number plates; she
saw the reason a moment later, in the shape of a stack of
detached plates of different numbers from all counties,
ranged along the wall.
</p>

<p>
Mecklen dragged her across to what looked like a big
tire cupboard.  This he opened, revealing it to be empty,
and fumbled with a bracket at the back.  In a few seconds
the false back slid sideways, laying bare a faintly lighted
passage.  Lew extinguished the garage light and made the
girl precede him into the tunnel, while he shut the cupboard
doors and slid home the inside panel.
</p>

<p>
There were only a dozen feet to go, and they emerged
into a spacious cellar.  Here Mecklen paused, rubbing his
scrubby chin as though wondering where to go next.  At
length he went over to a door which led off the vault in
which they stood, and he seemed surprised to find it empty.
He came back and seized her arm again.
</p>

<p>
"In hyar," he rasped, and almost flung her inside.
</p>

<p>
The door closed again, and she heard a bar thump into
its socket on the outside.
</p>

<p>
An electric bulb glowed in the ceiling, and she was thankful
for it.  She took stock of her position as calmly as she
could.  The room was more like a cupboard than a cellar—it
could have measured no more than eight feet by six.  It
had held a great deal of earth recently; the stone floor was
half an inch deep in it still, and small clods of damp soil
adhered to the walls.  There was no window—no outlet of
any sort except the door through which Lew had pushed her—but
the door itself fitted loosely in its frame, so that there
was no lack of air.  She went to the door and ran her fingers
under it.  Despite its clumsiness, it was fashioned of three-inch
oak.  It might have been three-inch boiler steel for all
the hope of escape it offered her; and, shoving her hardest,
she couldn't make it budge against the heavy outside bar
that held it shut.
</p>

<p>
Leaning against the wall, she thought out the
circumstances methodically.  For armoury she had the pin of a small
brooch and her two hands.  Expectations—what?  The story
about Storm being injured might or might not be true,
although now she was inclined to regard it as nothing more
than a cock-and-bull yarn invented to decoy her.  Strangely
enough, her first emotion was of exasperation; she, old
stager that she was, to have been caught on the hop with an
antediluvian parlour trick like that!  Well, how long would
it be before she was missed?  Terry, being an old friend of
Storm's, might go down to the hospital himself later on,
and then the fraud would be exposed.  Or, if he didn't do
that, and Storm was safe and sound, Kit'd be sure to ring
her up in the morning; and, once he'd absorbed the news
of her abduction, he wouldn't be likely to let grass grow
under his feet.  Extraordinarily comforting was that
thought.  Within a few hours—she looked at her watch—within
eight hours at the very limit Storm would know all
about it, would be out scouring the metropolis for her.  The
last feebly rising bubble of panic collapsed.  She was sure,
now, that Storm hadn't been smashed up.  He'd be On The
Job, moving heaven and earth to find her, and every
Triangle in Christendom massed up in one big wad all round
her, with barbed wire in front and a company of field
artillery behind, wouldn't stop him....
</p>

<p>
Her day-dreaming was interrupted by the return of
Mecklen, laden with a rough straw-filled mattress and a
couple of coarse blankets.  He dumped them on the floor
and went out again.  For a fraction of a second she had
meditated attacking him from behind when his hands were
full and his head turned, but the thought had died as quickly
as it was born.  She was strong and supple as a young mermaid,
but she knew that against his rugged bulk such crude
methods would be wasted.  She might have got him in a
ju-jitsu grip—she knew one or two——
</p>

<p>
He came back again that minute, carrying a small table
on which was an enamel mug of water, a loaf of bread,
some fried bacon congealing on a cracked plate, and a hunk
of butter wrapped in a scrap of newspaper.  Her chance
of springing on him unawares was gone now, for he kept
the table between them all the time.
</p>

<p>
"Make yoreself at home," he invited.  "Sorry I cain't
stay an' wait on yuh jest naow, but yew're supposed ter be
dead.  The boss might think et kind o' queer ef I stayed
grubbin' 'round these hyar cellars, an' it don't pay ter git
the boss's goat.  But I'll see yuh later—don't yew worry!"
</p>

<p>
His foul leer struck a qualm of terror into her heart, but
she faced him boldly.
</p>

<p>
"I don't worry," she said acidly.  "What's your name?"
</p>

<p>
"Mecklen—but yew kin call me Lew, honey."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mecklen, I've heard of you.  You've killed a good
many people in your time—have you ever wondered what
it's like to die?"
</p>

<p>
He lounged against the wall, grinning.
</p>

<p>
"Huh—yew li'l' cougar!  So yew're gonna make ole Lew
pass in his cheques, air yew?  Gee, baby, I'll say yew got
sand!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, I'm not going to kill you," said Susan.  "But
I'll tell you the name of someone who will.  Ever met
Captain Arden, the man they call <i>Storm</i>?  He's out hunting you
by this time, Mecklen, and d'you know what he'll do to you
when he gets you?  He did it to a man outside Valparaiso
once—a man rather like you, Mecklen—staked him out and
flogged him to death with a stock-whip!  How does that
appeal to you?  And he'll get you, Mecklen—there's no hole
and corner on God's earth you can hide in where he won't
find you one day.  Storm never gives up!  Think it over."
</p>

<p>
There was no idle threat or bravado in her tone.  She
stated the facts simply and cold-bloodedly, so that the
smooth venom behind them would have stabbed horror
into the soul of most men.  But Mecklen's imagination was
that of the untamed brute—he had to feel the lash before
he could flinch from a sight of it.
</p>

<p>
"Storm!" he scoffed.  "I'll tell yuh something.  That
sheik o' yores'll eat his breakfast right in this hyar shack.
Now think thet over!"
</p>

<p>
And then with a cat-like spring he rounded the table and
caught her in his arms in a bear's hug.  His fetid breath
stung her nostrils, and, before she could move, her lips had
tasted the gross contact of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
He jumped back, breathing heavily, one fist stuck out in
front of him.
</p>

<p>
"Keep off," he warned.  "Thet war jest something ter go
'long wit.  I'll kiss yuh—properly—later.  See yuh again
soon, honey.  Yew'll larn ter like ole Lew—he ain't no
amachoor!"
</p>

<p>
The door bumped shut behind him, and she was alone
again....  But now there was a new fear to face—something
that she'd never thought would come into her own
life, often as it occurred in the pages of the novelist.  The
tightest corner she'd ever been in....  She tried to stay the
involuntary quivering of her lips.  The hot defilement of
Mecklen's embrace seemed to sully them still, and she got
out her handkerchief and rubbed them with it.  Death itself
she could have met with a proud contempt, but that....
She sank on to the mattress he had brought and buried her
face in her hands.  She was ... desperately ... <i>afraid</i>....
</p>

<p>
Lew went stumbling up the cellar stairs with a burning
exaltation skipping about like a lump of molten lead in his
rotten heart.  He passed through the stairs into the back
hall, and was confronted by a small man whose ferrety face
was drawn and haggard.
</p>

<p>
"Lew!"  The little man grabbed Mecklen's sleeve
convulsively.  "Lew—I—I saw yer go dahn wiv a bundle 'f
beddin' an' then yer went agayne wiv a table 'n' grub.  I
was on the front stairs, an' I saw yer!"
</p>

<p>
Mecklen rested his hands on his hips.
</p>

<p>
"So li'l' Birdie sore ole Lew," he grated.  "Did yew!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes.  Wot's it mean—wot's it <i>mean</i>?"
</p>

<p>
Birdie seemed almost frantic.  His normally sallow
complexion was ashen, and he was shaking horribly, like a man
with ague, and an ugly look came into the gunman's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Air thet enny perticlar concern o' yores?" he drawled,
leaning forward so that his out-thrust jaw almost touched
Birdie's nose.
</p>

<p>
"Yes—I don't understand!  <i>Lew</i>!  Why're yer lookin'
at me like that?  My Gawd...."  A shifting light of madness
was coming into Birdie's staring eyes.  "Lew!  <i>'Oo's dahn
there?</i> ..."
</p>

<p>
"Yew li'l' four-flushin' piker!" snarled Mecklen.
</p>

<p>
His huge hands were clawing out for Birdie's throat.
They found their hold and, crushing the pickpocket's
scraggy neck in that boa-constrictor twist, Mecklen shook
him as a Great Dane might shake a poodle.
</p>

<p>
"Yew li'l' <i>runt</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Lew!"
</p>

<p>
It was Morini's voice, hard and imperative.  Mecklen
took no notice until the butt of a gun struck him a stinging
blow between the eyes.
</p>

<p>
Lew staggered back and Morini fronted him, having
reversed his automatic to the business position.
</p>

<p>
"Gat, yew vamoose!  Wot's bitin' yuh——"
</p>

<p>
"You've gone loco," Morini cut in with no suavity.
"What're you fightin' for?  If the Chief heard of this you'd
be fired right out into the streets, where half the bulls in
London are watching to draw a bead on you.  Out with
it—what's the trouble?"
</p>

<p>
"Thet li'l' critter——"
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
But Mecklen, aware that he had made a blunder in saying
even that much, had relapsed into a glowering silence.
Morini turned to Sands, who was cringing against the wall,
grasping and rubbing his throat where Lew's fingers had
left thick scarlet weals.
</p>

<p>
"What did you do, Birdie?"
</p>

<p>
Sands was crouching back, and then he made a sudden
dive for the door.
</p>

<p>
"I'll show yer!" he cried, and bolted down the cellar
steps.
</p>

<p>
Susan sat up with a start as the door of her cell burst
open and Birdie, wide-eyed and choking, crashed in.  An
instant later Mecklen's huge form loomed in the gap, and
then Morini pushed past him.
</p>

<p>
"Don't yer worry, missy," Birdie got out tremulously.
"I'll see yer fru—I 'ad a sister, once...."
</p>

<p>
"What's this?" snapped Morini, wheeling on Mecklen.
</p>

<p>
"Wotcha think?" growled Lew surlily.
</p>

<p>
His raging eyes were alert for Morini's every movement,
for he was twice the size of the other, and the broadcasting
of Susan's presence was going to spoil Lew's plans
considerably.  But Morini still had his gun, and he never
gave Mecklen a chance to catch him off his guard.
</p>

<p>
"This is the Hawthorne girl."  Gat's voice was fiery.
"You were told to leave her alone.  And, anyway, she was to
be killed.  Instead of that, you've showed her our
headquarters, and you're still keeping her alive, so that if she
got away we'd all be dished!  Lew, I've a good mind to
give you yours!"
</p>

<p>
All unobserved, Birdie had edged along the wall towards
the open door.  Lew and Morini stood just inside.
And then Sands leapt through the narrow gap like a
fleeing rat, and was halfway up the stairs before the other
two realised that he had gone.
</p>

<p>
"Keep yer pecker up, missy!" he bawled.  "I'll get the
pleece!"
</p>

<p>
Morini flung up his gun, but Susan kicked the table
against him as he fired, and the shot went wide.  The next
moment Birdie was out of sight, with Lew in cursing pursuit.
</p>

<p>
Susan caught Morini's wrist and wrenched it round
with all her strength.  His gun clattered to the floor, and
he closed with her in a short, whirling, hand-to-hand tussle.
Susan fought back at him furiously, but the man was wiry
and as slippery as an eel.  In less than a minute she found
both her elbows locked behind her back.
</p>

<p>
"I know ju-jitsu too," he grunted, and kicked his fallen
gun out into the passage.
</p>

<p>
He threw her from him violently, and the door was shut
and barred from outside before she could rise again.
</p>

<p>
Birdie could run!  He made the front door before Lew
had reached the head of the cellar steps, and Mecklen was
left gaping at an empty hall.  Birdie had got away!  Fear
of what would happen if the pickpocket reached a police
station and squealed had temporarily paralysed Lew's
faculties.  It took him some seconds to soak up the immense
significance of the disaster, and in that time Morini, more
agile of mind and body, had passed him at a sprint.
</p>

<p>
Birdie had tumbled down the front steps, moaning aloud
with apprehension.  There wasn't much mettle in Birdie
Sands—gutter-born, gutter-reared, and gutter-minded, he
was totally unfitted to play any more blackguardly part
than that of the petty sneak-thief.  And what he'd gone
through that night had shivered his brittle nerves to
fragments.  He'd killed a man, and you could be hanged for
that....  The ghastly sight he had seen in Fleet Street
haunted his vision.  And then the girl—that had been the
final straw that broke him down.  The splits'd say he was a
party to that crime, too.  And he knew, or divined
instinctively, what fate was in store for her....
</p>

<p>
"Gawd, let me get aw'y!" he mumbled, panting.
"P'r'aps they'd let me off wiv a laggin' if I syved <i>'er</i>....  I
'ad a sister once...."
</p>

<p>
His chest felt as if it was bursting, and a steel band
seemed to have tightened round his heart.  His legs were
like lead.  He was travelling terribly slowly now, as though
in a nightmare.  Athletic training had never entered his life,
and chain-smoking had ruined whatever natural stamina
he had ever possessed.  He couldn't keep up that killing
pace....
</p>

<p>
Would they follow him through the streets?  The
thought almost made his knees give out like over-heated
bearings.  For some unknown reason it didn't occur to him
to shout for help.
</p>

<p>
Morini opened the front door and looked up and down
the road.  He had moved fast.  Birdie was not seventy feet
away, running flat-footedly, with his elbows splayed out
and his head down, all but done in already.
</p>

<p>
To shoot would be suicidal—it would bring the whole
neighbourhood about their ears in two shakes.  Morini
knew a better way than that.  He dropped his gun into his
pocket and brought his hand out again with a long, heavy,
but beautifully balanced knife.  He poised it in his palm;
and then, as Birdie passed under the full glare of a street
lamp, Gat's arm went back and came forward again with
amazing speed....
</p>

<p>
The knife flashed out with a low <i>whuu-uit</i>!  He saw the
flickering sheen of it as it skimmed away like a darting
splash of quicksilver, saw Birdie go down with the haft of
it sticking out between his shoulder-blades, heard Birdie's
shuddering scream gurgle away into an awful sob....
</p>

<p>
Morini stepped back into the hall and closed the door
without a sound.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br><br>
VISITORS FOR JOAN
</h3>

<p>
Long after midnight Joan Sands had sat curled up on the
chesterfield.  Through the open window had come the thunder
of the Piccadilly explosion, but she had not even gone
to the window to try and find out the meaning of the noise
and shouting.  Something dreadful had happened, and the
Triangle was in it.  One didn't have to be a clairvoyant to
realise that without making a personal inspection.  And
where the Triangle went Jimmy went—even to the gallows....
</p>

<p>
She consumed cigarette after cigarette, without tasting
or enjoying a single one, and her eyes were bloodshot with
the smart of straying smoke.  It was a purely mechanical
process, a device to assist thought or to prevent it—she was
not sure which.  At least the narcotic had a soothing effect
on her overwrought nerves, and having something to
manipulate with her fingers kept her within certain
materialistic bounds.  The same applied to the stiff
whisky-and-soda she had mixed herself; half of it was still in the
glass beside her—she had gulped half of it down, and had
not touched the rest since.
</p>

<p>
A queer, hectically coloured jazz-pattern mind had this
slim, fluffily beautiful girl.  Now those jazz-patterns had
kaleidoscoped into a medley of nightmare imaginings.  The
only light in the room came from the red-shaded reading
lamp behind her head, and the shadows around her, with
their crimson high-lights, grouped themselves into the real
semblance of her dire grotesque visions.  She would have
sold the world for company at that hour, for the comforting
presence of someone strong and calm and friendly
who'd hold her in his arms and scare away the bogeys with
a cheery word.  Jimmy, for instance.  In those last few days
he'd shown a sympathy one wouldn't have suspected him of
possessing and a strength of character which was the last
thing on earth an ex-jailbird waster ought by rights to have
trumped out.  Or Storm would have done.  She wished she'd
made him stay—bar Jimmy, he was the only man who'd
ever had a kind word for her, who'd ever treated her four-square,
with no <i>arrière-pensée</i>.  And the realisation that she
no longer felt capable of standing on her own feet and
facing things out alone was the hardest of all to bear—she,
the ice-hearted, cool, calculating adventuress, was getting
soft; while even jelly-spined sops like Jimmy were suddenly
sprouting shells.  The fact that Jimmy's new-found backbone
had awakened in her a genuine respect—something
that was tending to passionate love—didn't enter into the
balance sheet for the moment.  There were weaknesses and
tender patches in her armour that she'd never encountered
before, and the discovery of them was a salutary lesson to
conceit.  Joan failed to derive any enjoyment from the
revelation.  Shock education takes some standing up to.
She preferred the Montessori system.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, all recrimination and sentiment aside, the fact
remained that she felt intolerably lonely and unhappy.  For
the second time in her life she was utterly sincere, and she
was unable to decide whether her primary reaction to this
unaccustomed attitude was shame or—fright.  Not, of
course, that she figured the whole thing out in such a precise
scientific manner.  Her introspection ran on lines which
combined the antics of a giant switchback and a roundabout,
but the general trend of them was much simpler.
</p>

<p>
She must have dozed at last, for a stealthy movement
beside her recalled her to objective thinking with a big
jump.  She looked up, shaking the hair out of her eyes.
There was a man standing beside her couch.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy!" she breathed.  "How did you get here?"
</p>

<p>
She was getting up, but he put out a hand and gently
forced her back, sitting down beside her.  He looked very
tired, but he was smiling.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't stay away.  I was supposed to stay till
to-morrow, but I'd done my—business—and there didn't
seem to be any point in sticking on.  So I came back on the
night train.  Why're you up so late, Joan?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh—I don't know," she said petulantly.  "Why can't I
sit up if I feel like it?  I didn't feel tired."
</p>

<p>
He was gazing fixedly at her, and then he took her face
between his two hands and turned it so that the light fell
full across it.
</p>

<p>
"That's not true.  Something's happened—I can see it
in your eyes."  His finger moved and brushed two little
drops of dew from her cheek.  "You've been crying.  Joan!
What is it?"
</p>

<p>
She said nothing, pulling his hands away and bowing
her head again into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
"Have the police been here, Joan?"
</p>

<p>
He was looking about the apartment, but she had replaced
the rugs and furniture so that there was no trace of
Storm's visit.
</p>

<p>
"The Triangle have blown up Piccadilly—my taxi driver
told me about it," he said.  "Is that it?  Or did the men come
through from the next room and—and annoy you?"
</p>

<p>
He could hear the quick hissing intake of her breath.
And then, with a little gasping cry, she drooped into his
arms.
</p>

<p>
"Joan"—fiercely—"<i>Joan!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"All right, boy."  Her hands went up and passed behind
his head.  "I was worried—because of you.  And crying—because
of you.  Because—because—oh, Jimmy, say it for me!"
</p>

<p>
"Because you love me," he said unevenly.  "Joan ... my
darling girl...."
</p>

<p>
Somehow they had both come to their feet.  Never in all
Mattock's flabby life, never in Joan's hard life, had either
known a moment to compare with that one.  She had married
him to please him, and she'd never made any secret
of it.  But now...
</p>

<p>
He kissed her lips, her hair, her eyes, straining her to
him.  Heaven lay around him like a flame; the glory of it
eddied through his veins like fire.
</p>

<p>
"Joan, I'm a rotten old buffer for you to fall in love
with," he muttered.  "But I'll try to wash that away.  We'll
go on a proper honeymoon—anywhere you like—out of
here—give up this flat——"
</p>

<p>
"No—no!"  She broke away from him almost savagely.
"You've got to listen.  The busies've been here to-night.
Arden and Teal.  They searched the place—look!"
</p>

<p>
He pulled her roughly back into his arms.
</p>

<p>
"What does that matter?" he demanded.  "What does
anything else in life matter besides this?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing....  But you must look, Jimmy."
</p>

<p>
She forced him to turn so that he faced the damaged
bookcase.  He stared at it dumbly, and she felt him go stiff,
but he shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"Have you broken it or something?"
</p>

<p>
She pulled open the hidden door, showing him the
headphones and transmitter.
</p>

<p>
"This is your bookcase—you had it sent in, though I've
never seen you go to it.  It was always locked.  Arden showed
me—that's a cut-in on the telephone in the next room, and
Arden said the Triangle gave orders to his men <i>from here</i>.
There was a letter for you from the Apex.  Arden showed
that to me too.  You left it behind.  Jimmy, I know what
your business was in Devonshire!  What's the use of
keeping up the pretence?"  She looked straight at him.  "<i>What
time did your train get in?</i>"
</p>

<p>
He said nothing, and there was a long silence.  His face
was working strangely.  She saw the old devil rousing again
in his staring eyes, and ran to him in a panic.
</p>

<p>
"They may be back any time—maybe they were watching
and saw you come in!  I've got two bags packed.  I had
them ready waiting for you.  We've got passports—we've
got to get away!  Jimmy——"
</p>

<p>
<i>Zzzzzzing!...  Zzzzzzing!...</i>
</p>

<p>
The strident voice of the hall bell cut short the incoherent
stammer of words that tumbled from her lips, and for a
space of time it seemed as if her heart stopped beating.  And
when it moved again, it pounded like a two-stroke piston.
The busies had seen Mattock come in....  They were going
to arrest him....  His face went white; yet still he stood
motionless as a statue, gazing at the bookcase with
unseeing eyes.
</p>

<p>
<i>Zzzzzzing!...  Zzzzzzing-zing!...</i>
</p>

<p>
"They're here!  Jimmy—what's wrong with you?  Why
don't you do something?"  She glanced frantically about
her.  His immobility was maddening.  His brain seemed to
have gone dead.  "The other room—they mightn't look
there——"
</p>

<p>
<i>Zzzzzzing!...  Zzzzzzing-zing!...</i>
</p>

<p>
It was the flimsiest of flimsy hopes; but if she could stall
them off for a couple of minutes he might have time to
break away before the cordon closed.  She must centre all
their attention on the one door while he got through the
other.
</p>

<p>
The bag she had packed for him stood in one corner.  She
thrust it into his hand, and his fingers closed on the grip
mechanically.  The partition door was still ajar, but she had
almost to barge him through the gap.  He was gone at last,
and with a gasp of relief she closed and wedged the door
and hastily tidied her hair.  Then she went unsteadily down
the hall.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sure I Beg Your Pardon," said Joe Blaythwayt
politely.
</p>

<p>
So great was the shock that for a moment she just gaped
blankly at him, while he came inside and wiped his shoes
fastidiously on the mat.
</p>

<p>
"A most irregular hour for calling, madam," he remarked.
"I trust you will Forgive the Intrusion, and—er—Feel
No Alarm on account of my Presence.  I am a Widower,
and therefore not Impressionable.  The Urgency of my
Business is my excuse."
</p>

<p>
When Joe was excited the intangible Capital Letters
which decorated his pompous speech multiplied exceedingly.
He was clearly excited at that moment.  A light which in
anybody else would have been called martial shone in his
eyes and his grasp on his umbrella was fidgety.
</p>

<p>
Recovering slightly she closed the door behind him and
led him into the sitting-room.  There had been nobody else
to be seen in the corridor.
</p>

<p>
"Now what d'you want?" she asked sharply.
</p>

<p>
"I want to see Jimmy," he replied, so bluntly that she
was taken aback.
</p>

<p>
"Jimmy's in Devonshire—you know that," she said.
</p>

<p>
His cherubic blue eyes wandered round the room, and
came to rest at last on a felt hat which lay on the floor by
the chesterfield.  Before she could stop him he had picked
it up and seen the name written in the lining.
</p>

<p>
"This wasn't here when I was!" he squeaked excitedly.
"Jimmy's been here since we left!  Where is he?"
</p>

<p>
"I brought that in to clean a stain off it," she told him
calmly.  "Jimmy won't be back till to-morrow.  If you want
to see him so badly try again to-morrow evening."
</p>

<p>
He wiggled a fat forefinger all but in her face, literally
dancing in his agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Woman, Do Not Lie To Me!"  His flustered effervescence
resulted in speech that fairly bristled with capitals.
"I Want The Truth.  Jimmy Has Been Here.  Jimmy Is
Here!  Where's he hiding?  Where's he gone?  What've you
done with him?  Answer Me!"
</p>

<p>
Question overflowed question in one delirious cataract but
Joan had recovered her composure to some extent by this
time.
</p>

<p>
"What's your game?" she demanded hotly.  "Coming
into my flat at this hour of the night and making a scene!
Get out, Blaythwayt.  Who d'you think you are?  Who are
you?  Some fly cop—one of these clever busies out of a
serial?"
</p>

<p>
"No, madam—my Warrant!"
</p>

<p>
With an air of a conjuror he produced from his waistcoat
pocket a glittering silver and enamel badge, and she
recoiled in horrified amazement from the sign of the Triangle.
</p>

<p>
It is doubtful if he observed her perturbation at all.  At
all events he ignored it.  His blue eyes swept the room again,
peering at every nook as though he expected to find Mattock
concealed behind a flower-pot or cached behind a picture.
He saw the closed partition door, and let out an electrifying
squawk of eagerness.  She saw the inspiration dawn in his
brain, and made an instinctive movement to block the
way—a rash step which she instantly regretted.
</p>

<p>
"Stand Aside, Madam," he commanded tremblingly;
and, when she did not budge, he pulled her rudely away and
kicked open the door.
</p>

<p>
She tried to hold him back, impelled by she knew not
what fear, but he flung her off like a child.  He dashed into
the other room and she followed him to find him blinking
open-mouthed at emptiness.  Mattock's bag stood on the
table but Mattock himself was gone and the door leading
into the passage stood wide.
</p>

<p>
For some seconds they were both petrified.  And then Joe
Blaythwayt gave vent to one strangled yelp of apprehension
and rushed across the room, and she heard him go blinding
down the corridor towards the stairs.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV
<br><br>
MAHOMET AND THE MOUNTAIN
</h3>

<p>
Susan had thought she would never have been able to sleep
that night, but she managed it somehow.  She had waited
for an hour and a half after Morini had dashed out of the
cellars, and, when he failed to return, she lay down on the
mattresses and pulled a blanket over her.  For a long time
her thoughts gave her no rest.  They milled and clamoured
tumultuously through her head, whirling her through mazes
of doubt and perplexity and conjuring up hideous visions
to line the route.  And then, in some miraculous fashion that
nevertheless seemed eminently natural, the hullabaloo
merged into a dull monotonous humming blackness, and
with a detached, infinitely distant interest she observed
herself sinking into great dark depths of fathomless quiet....
</p>

<p>
She awoke with a start, roused by the sound of someone
unbarring the door, and looked at her watch.  To her
surprise she found that it was nearly nine o'clock.
</p>

<p>
The man who entered was not Mecklen, but Morini.  She
was glad of that, illogically, for, although the gentle Gat
was probably as sinister a scoundrel as Lew, he was far
less obtrusively so.  Mecklen had never been a gentleman,
and was therefore inclined to be somewhat vulgar in his
villainy; Morini might be more dangerous, but he was less
repulsive, and she felt more in the mood for tackling a
Morini than a Mecklen.
</p>

<p>
As it happened, however, there was nothing menacing
about the educated Gat that morning.  He was carrying a
tray which had been decorated with a clean white cloth and
which was laden with much more attractive fare than
Mecklen had brought her the previous night.  The coffee-pot
was silver, and the jug of steaming milk was spotless;
there were two slices of toast in a rack, and eggs and bacon
reposed on a plate that was neither chipped nor cracked;
he had added an immaculate cup to replace the battered
enamel mug which Mecklen had given her, and had even
remembered to include a napkin.
</p>

<p>
He gave her a polite "Good morning," and smiled as he
noted her puzzlement at the stainless furniture of his
burden.
</p>

<p>
"These things belong to the Chief," he explained.  "He
isn't home for breakfast, so you're in luck."
</p>

<p>
He leaned against the door and watched her eat.  She was
able to muster a respectable appetite, and was especially
grateful for the refreshing heat of the coffee, for the
cellars were none too warm.  The only other discomfort she
had felt was a certain stiffness from her cramped bedding,
but a little free movement would soon remedy that.
</p>

<p>
She became aware that Morini was looking at her
curiously, although he never descended to the Mecklenian
coarseness of a stare, and when she had finished she sat
back and returned his gaze inquiringly.  For answer, he
smiled again and extended a gold cigarette case.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you."  She helped herself, and accepted the
proffered match.  "The last gasper before execution,
Morini?"
</p>

<p>
"It is rather like it," he admitted coolly, and glanced
round the tiny room.  "Condemned cell and all—except that
real condemned cells are cleaner.  I wonder if you will die
to-day?"
</p>

<p>
He posed the contingency with a speculative air that was
terrifyingly humorous.
</p>

<p>
"Last night you were cursing Mecklen for not killing
me," she remarked.  "Why haven't you rectified the omission?"
</p>

<p>
He twisted his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"You'd better see the Chief first, now you're here.  He's
due to arrive at any minute."
</p>

<p>
He was preoccupied, as though some big problem filled
his mind, and she saw that it was useless to attempt to
discover what plans had been made for her disposal.
</p>

<p>
He picked up the tray and left her.  A strange unreality
had overcast everything with a haze which prevented her
from working things out collectedly.  This dispassionate
discussion of murder jarred against all canons of actuality.
Even in a court of law there was some emotion about a
death sentence—one couldn't, somehow, flurry up any panic
about a threat delivered in such a matter-of-fact tone....
</p>

<p>
Morini was back in a quarter of an hour, and his face
was woodenly expressionless.
</p>

<p>
"The Chief's arrived," he said.  "He wants to see you.
Come along, please."
</p>

<p>
As in a dream she followed him.  He took her through the
hall, and she saw little mounds of dry earth untidily swept
up into the corners.  Halfway down he opened a door, and
she had a glimpse of luxurious velvet hangings which had
something familiar about them: royal purple with golden
arabesques.  Suddenly she realised where it was she had
first seen those exotic decorations—the sawmill at
Billingsgate!  So, somehow, the conceit of the madman had made
him take the enormous risk of stealing his gorgeous
trappings away from a place over which the police still kept
watch.  He had carted away the earth that had filled the house
in Buckingham Gate, packing it in crates and removing it
in lorries at dead of night, to be dumped in the deserted
quarries around Purley, simply to gratify the vanity of his
megalomaniac mind.  The method of his accomplishing the
feat, of course, she could not know, but the completed fact
gave her yet another queer sidelight on his weird mentality.
</p>

<p>
Morini slipped into the room, leaving the door slightly
ajar, and she heard the brief conversation which passed
between him and the man who sat in the room.
</p>

<p>
"Here she is, Chief."
</p>

<p>
"Bring her in, then."
</p>

<p>
"Right....  Oh, by the way, Chief, Lew went slinking
out to a coffee-stall just before dawn—the darn
chaw-bacon!—and he came back through the garage.  He said
there was somebody skulking round in the mews, and
somebody else busy doing nothing in a doorway on the street
outside.  I don't see how the 'tecs could've got a line on us,
but Lew swears to those two rubber-necks."
</p>

<p>
"There wasn't anyone about when I came in."
</p>

<p>
"Maybe it was just a couple of hoboes, boss.  Lew ought
to dilute it.  Just thought I'd mention it."
</p>

<p>
Morini appeared in the doorway again and beckoned the
girl in.  She entered with her head held high, walking as
coolly as if she were strolling into a hat shop to take a
look round.  She only gave one glance to the furnishings
of the room—enough to see that it had been fitted out into
an exact replica, on a smaller scale, of the council hall in
Lower Thames Street.
</p>

<p>
Another thought occupied her mind.  Two men had been
stalking round the mews early that morning, if Lew were to
be believed....  Already Storm was on the move, though
she couldn't imagine how he had managed to locate the
house of her imprisonment.  That was an awkward snag in
the way of rescue which hadn't occurred to her until that
moment, and she was glad it hadn't cropped up before it
had been surmounted.  She had always been blessed with
nerves of ice; even before the peril of Mecklen's innuendoes
she hadn't wept or gone into hysterics or lashed around the
cellar beating frantically on the walls in an ecstasy of terror,
and, now that the clouds looked like breaking in the near
future, her heart even sang a cheery refrain.
</p>

<p>
Storm was getting busy, and Storm was no moss-harvester
when the fur promised to fly.
</p>

<p>
Susan smiled in confident bravado as she turned towards
the daïs she knew she would see at the far end of the room.
As in the sawmill, the huge emblem of the Triangle was
suspended a little to one side of the throne; and, on the
throne itself, sat a big built man, shabbily clad in rough
grey tweeds.  She did not recognise him, for a black felt hat
was pulled down over his eyes and a black silk handkerchief
folded diagonally was tied round his head, hiding his
features from cheek bone to chin.  All she could see of his face
was the pale luminous glint of his blue eyes as he gazed
fixedly at her.  He sat back, with his gloved hands clasped
on his knees, moveless as a sculpture in tinted marble.
</p>

<p>
All those details she took in in that first fleeting glimpse.
It was half a second later that she saw that the Triangle was
not alone on the platform.  Another man stood beside
him....
</p>

<p>
It was an immaculately dressed man, tall and broad
shouldered.  One hand rested arrogantly on his hip, and he was
smiling a trifle grimly.  She recognised him with a thrill of
amazement, which changed instantly to a qualm of incredulous
fear....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Storm came out of the Albany swinging his stick, the
inevitable cigarette lofting jauntily between his lips.  To
have seen him, you would have taken him for an unusually
athletic specimen of the Idle Rich, and you would have
jeered lustily at the mere suggestion of his having any
heavier cares in the world than the selection of elegant
shirtings and tasteful hosiery.  In fact, an ideal model for a
portrait of one of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> sallying forth in quest of
the matutinal cocktail.
</p>

<p>
Huh!
</p>

<p>
Well, you hit the bull with one shot—his cares lay lightly
on his muscular shoulders; for, big as those cares were, he
possessed one of those pigeon-holed minds in the various
compartments of which the fortunate owner can always
hermetically seal away anything with which he does not
want to be bothered at the moment.  Storm's plan of
action was already mapped out and blue-printed; and,
granted that the other side played up in accordance with the
laws of probability, that plan was bound to succeed as far
as he had designed it.  True, his scheme didn't take him all
the way home; but, there again, sufficient unto the hour
was the worry thereof.  Doubtless the god who watches over
all merry fools who go pelting in where archangels would
hesitate to show the tip of a wing would provide for the
aftermath.  Theoretically speaking, the man who can wedge
his head into a lion's jaws can get it out again.  A
somewhat risky theory to put into practice, but Storm happened
to be the sort of intrepid scapegrace who gets a kick out
of fool gambles like that.
</p>

<p>
And it was all so beautifully simple.  Thus far, the
Mountain had shown great enthusiasm for the company of
Mahomet, but Mahomet had steadfastly declined to visit the
Mountain.  In its eagerness, the Mountain had even
detached portions of itself to go in search of Mahomet and
convey him into the Presence; but Mahomet had remained
obdurate—even violently obdurate—and kept his distance.
And now the Mountain was more zealous than ever, with
the difference that Mahomet had changed his mind and had
been seized with an overpowering desire to pay a call on the
Mountain.  Therefore, the transition into the presence of the
said Mountain should be easy....
</p>

<p>
In Piccadilly a taxi was crawling along by the kerb very
conveniently.  Behind it followed another, also seeking
whom it might transport; and, behind that one, trailed a
third.  In the offing was a fourth.  The ghost of a smile
hovered on Storm's mouth.  Verily, the anxiety of the
Mountain appeared to be exceeding great....
</p>

<p>
Without hesitation, Arden waved his stick at the leading
driver, and the taxi swung into a stop with commendable
promptness.  As Storm opened the door his keen eye
detected the automatic lock which nine hundred and ninety-nine
ordinary passengers out of a thousand wouldn't have
noticed; he marked also the steel netting between the
double panes of the window, and observed how neatly the sash
had been screwed up so that nothing less than a jemmy
would open it.  Leaning over to give his instructions to the
driver, he saw that steel shutters had been fitted inside
the cab against the glass partition between the driver and
passenger, so that the chauffeur would be in no danger
of being stuck up with a gun smashed through the glass by
a refractory prisoner.
</p>

<p>
"Number Ten, Downing Street," said Storm solemnly,
and climbed in.
</p>

<p>
The driver himself, with a courtesy unwonted in taxi-drivers,
got down to make sure that the door was properly
shut, and Storm guessed that when the driver returned to
his perch the automatic lock would also be efficiently
latched.
</p>

<p>
They moved off towards Piccadilly Circus, where
perspiring constables were struggling to man[oe]uvre a dense
millipede of cursing traffic round the narrow gallery which
was all the route that was navigable until the hordes of
navvies who were even then at work had repaired some of
the damage done by the last night's explosion.  Kit sat back
comfortably, crushed out the butt of his cigarette beneath
his heel, and lighted a second.  Looking through the
wire-netted window at the back, he saw that another taxi, empty
but with its flag down, tailed along in the rear.  He could
identify the chauffeur—an unsavoury-looking thug whose
license had been suspended indefinitely some months ago
after a curious accident which had attracted the fruitless
attention of the Public Prosecutor.
</p>

<p>
Satisfied that his head was well and truly padlocked
between the jaws of a particularly ferocious lion, Storm
searched the interior of his own cab for any possible booby
traps.  A careful examination, however, disclosed nothing
more deadly than a small spanner under the carpet, and the
speaking tube which communicated with the driver.  He did
not put an agile employed of chloroform, or even
some more subtle gas, beyond the resources of the Triangle,
and therefore he plugged the mouthpiece of the tube with a
handkerchief packed in as tightly as his strong fingers could
jam it.  So far everything had been admirably plain sailing,
even if a shade too close to the wind to suit the nervy, and
it wouldn't do to have everything messed up by sleep dope.
But, now that he was sure there was no secret gas inlet, he
composedly devoted himself to blowing smoke rings and
wondering—the truth must be told—exactly how long it
took one to get married in England.  The precariousness of
his present position left him unruffled.  He was virtually a
captive, on his way to a personal interview with the Big
Triangle, and that was exactly what he had wanted; for
Mahomet hadn't the foggiest notion where to find the
Mountain unless he was taken there.  Storm had got his
ambition, and the Apex had got his—whether the Triangle
would be satisfied with the one hundred and seventy pounds
of consolidated Gehenna they had collected remained to
be seen....
</p>

<p>
"We are now," mused Storm lightly, "fairly and
squarely in the cart.  It happens to be a non-stop bus, and
only runs one way.... <i>Jee</i>-ru-sa-lem!"
</p>

<p>
He was not interested in their progress down Haymarket
and into Trafalgar Square, but when the taxi cut round into
the Mall he sat up and began to take notice.  It occurred to
him that a little realism might be introduced into the
entertainment at this juncture, and he began to hammer on the
steel shutters and rattle the locked doors.  The taxi
continued on its way unheeding.  After a moment's thought he
pulled his big automatic, smashed the right-hand window
with the butt, and got his fingers behind the netting which
intervened against the second pane.  Strong as he was,
he could not dislodge it, so, instead, he twisted the muzzle
of his gun through the mesh and sent a bullet snarling past
the chauffeur's ear.  The cab swerved and then accelerated
vigorously, and he sank back on the seat again with a soft
laugh.
</p>

<p>
He had not fired to raise an alarm, but he saw immediately
the measures which had been provided to deal with
him if he had attempted to do so in earnest.  The taxi which
followed them drew quickly abreast, and he caught sight of
Lew Mecklen leaning out of the window.  He thought of
pipping Lew through the neck, <i>pour encourager les autres</i>,
but before he could put his idea into effect Mecklen swung
up a syringe which resembled a chemical fire extinguisher.
There was a sharp hiss, and a cloud of acrid spray billowed
into the cab.
</p>

<p>
For a moment nothing happened, and then Storm reeled,
gasping, into the far corner.  His nostrils stung with the
pungent fumes of liquid ammonia, he choked and coughed
and writhed, his eyes were a streaming agony of blindness.
"Yew try again, ya big cheese," taunted Lew from the
other taxi.  "Try again, ya big stiff, an' I'll flop yuh wit'
anot'er squoit—jest fer bendin' some lead into ole Lew's
leg, youse!"
</p>

<p>
"All right, ole Lew," muttered Storm, panting.  "We'll
argue about that later!  Hully gee—that stuff's worse than
slumber mixture!"
</p>

<p>
He took no more pot shots, but concentrated on getting
the pain out of his eyes and regaining vision, for he badly
wanted to know where they were taking him, and he had
no wish at all to be helpless when they brought him into the
presence of the Apex.  When he could see again, he found
that they were travelling down a street of imposing, austere
houses, and it was only a couple of seconds before he had
oriented himself.  He saw Wellington Barracks on his left,
and half a minute later the taxi whisked down a side street
and turned into a mews, Mecklen's cab following.  The
second cab stopped, Lew got down and opened the door of
one of the garages, and Storm was driven right in.  Through
the back window Kit saw the door barred behind them, and
then Mecklen came round and poked the nozzle of his
ammonia syringe through the broken window.
</p>

<p>
"T'row out yore gat," he commanded.
</p>

<p>
"I can't unless you open something," Storm pointed out.
</p>

<p>
This fact hadn't occurred to Lew, and after a while the
door was moved a cautious three inches.
</p>

<p>
"T'row it out."
</p>

<p>
Storm obeyed, and the door was fully opened and the
ammonia jet stuck into his face.
</p>

<p>
"Git down—an' no rough stuff, or I'll draown yuh wit'
this."
</p>

<p>
Storm got out, smiling amusedly at the apprehensive care
with which Lew trained the spray on his every movement.
Storm's jaw was thrust forward, his cigarette canted
almost vertically, his lips, drawn up at the corners, showed
a gleam of white teeth.  Everything functioned exactly as
per invoice.  He was in the enemy's camp, and every muscle
in his body was tingling with joyous anticipation.
</p>

<p>
"Frisk 'im," snapped Mecklen.
</p>

<p>
Arden opened his arms as a habitual criminal does in
the police station, and the first taxi-driver came up and
searched him.  The taxi-driver was not gentle or squeamish,
for the bullet which had zipped past his ear had alarmed
him considerably, and he made what he thought was a
thorough fanning.  That he found nothing was not his fault;
he even prodded Storm in the small of the back, doubtless
with memories of the Marlborough Street episode, but drew
blank.  Storm had sixteen-inch biceps, and the chain mail he
wore effectively disguised the outline of his arm-holsters.
At length the chauffeur stepped back and signified that he
was satisfied, but Lew did not lower the squirt.
</p>

<p>
"Over thar—by thet cupboard," he ordered.  "Start
anyt'ing, an' I'll douse yuh!"
</p>

<p>
"You're mad as a meat-axe, Lew," said Storm commiseratingly.
"I want to see the Big Triangle first.  You flatter
yourself!  I guess I can kill you any time."
</p>

<p>
"Yah!" sneered the gunman, and Storm winced.
</p>

<p>
"You do make vulgar noises, Lew," he protested mildly.
</p>

<p>
Mecklen leaned over the syringe he still pointed at Kit's
face.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, buddy.  Thet heavy date o' yores is hyar, an' yew
kin tell her ole Lew's sweet on her.  We got the moll right
hyar, an' she'll never git out again."
</p>

<p>
"That's why I came," said Storm calmly.
</p>

<p>
Mecklen scowled.  As we have seen, he was not a man of
high intellect, and Storm's frigid imperturbability made
him uneasy.  Like the armour of assurance which enveloped
Snooper Brome, it was something which he couldn't deal
with.  It was as hopelessly out of his depth as the fourth
dimension.  Every way of attack he tried he came up against
those invisible spikes, and bafflement filled him with futile
anger.
</p>

<p>
"I was told ter kill her, but I jest brought her home an'
necked her.  Don't that make yuh feel glad?"
</p>

<p>
"Not half so glad as you'll feel when I shoot you through
the stomach instead of through the heart!"
</p>

<p>
"Last night she gimme the air, but before I'm t'rough
she'll be proud ter marry me," persisted Lew.
</p>

<p>
Storm rolled his cigarette across to the other corner of
his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"Loud cheers!" he drawled.  "Going to reform, are you?"
</p>

<p>
One of the chauffeurs had opened up the panel at the
back of the tire cupboard, and was standing waiting by the
gap.  Mecklen jerked his head towards the tunnel.
</p>

<p>
"In wit' yuh!"
</p>

<p>
"Sure!"
</p>

<p>
But Storm paused before stooping in, for the glaring
hate in the gunman's eyes had roused in him an irresistible
temptation to add a final tab to his brief baiting of that
unlovable murderer.
</p>

<p>
"You know, Lew," he murmured affably, "every day and
in every way you grow more and more like an overfed dog-louse!"
</p>

<p>
Then he entered the passage, and as he went Mecklen
landed out a vicious kick.  Storm never stopped or looked
round.  Mecklen would keep a little longer.  Kissed Susan,
had he?  Arden reckoned that that kiss would turn out to be
the most expensive one in Lew's amorous career.  As for
the kick, that would only add extra zest to the extraction of
due payment.  Lew's shins were within easy reach of a smart
backward hack, but Storm deemed it inadvisable to court
a fresh shower of ammonia, for he knew he would need
all his faculties to be at concert pitch during the next hour
or two, and his eyes were still twinging from the effects of
the first dose he had received.
</p>

<p>
They emerged into the cellars, and one chauffeur led the
way to the stairs.  Halfway across, Storm's foot brushed
against something which went rattling across the stone
floor, so that Lew and the other man pulled up with a start.
</p>

<p>
"Only a mouse," said Storm genially.  "I'll hold your
hands if you're scared."
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" demanded Mecklen sharply.
</p>

<p>
He was peering around fearfully, and presently he saw
what had made the noise—a fountain pen heavily encrusted
with gold work.  He picked it up and looked at it
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Thet yores, Arden?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said Storm boredly.  "Combination turnip-slicer,
gramophone, trouser-press and portable aeroplane."
</p>

<p>
He reached out a hand for it, but Mecklen thrust the
pen into a pocket and pushed him away.
</p>

<p>
"Keep movin'," he growled.  "Funny, ain't yuh?  Mebbe
yew'll be sick presently."
</p>

<p>
"I shall if I see much more of you," remarked Storm
crudely.
</p>

<p>
"One day," threatened Lew sullenly, "I'm gonna make
yuh wish yew'd never bin born.  Yew flap yore mouth too
much.  I'm gonna——"
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there," yawned Storm, and Mecklen relapsed into
a pugnacious silence.
</p>

<p>
As Storm climbed the steps an odd, dancing, metallic
laughter glittered in his grey eyes.  That fountain pen had
given an entirely new twist to the situation, and as yet
he was unable to gauge whether the twist was going to be
big or small.  For Storm knew and had recognised the ornate
filigree with which the pen was embellished, and he
wondered what business James Norman Mattock might have in
Buckingham Gate that morning.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI
<br><br>
SECONDS OUT OF THE RING
</h3>

<p>
"Believe we've met before, Captain Arden," said the
Apex.  "Somehow I can't get into the way of calling you
Kit."
</p>

<p>
"Don't bother to try," advised Storm.  "Somehow, I
can't get into the way of calling you father."
</p>

<p>
Ezra Surcon sat down again on his throne, taking in
every detail of Storm's appearance with a keenly
appreciative eye.  It was a strange meeting between father and
son, that.  Family love is mostly a matter of long proximity,
and there had been none of that between those two.  No
affection was in their clashing glances—Storm's interrogating,
half-mirthful, accusing, dangerous, assured, level;
Surcon's full of frank admiration blended with a trace of
fear.  Neither hate nor love was in the air, yet the
atmosphere bristled with something far more potent.
Circumstances had thrown them together to do battle on opposite
sides of the law; battle to the death, fought out with words
alone right up to the final <i>mêlée</i>—surely the strangest
encounter in the annals of crime.
</p>

<p>
"You're like your mother, son," said Surcon slowly.
"You've got that cornfield Saxon hair of hers, and her
eyes.  And yet you're <i>me</i>....  I used to stand up that way,
once—that proud, reckless way...."
</p>

<p>
There was a short silence, while Storm met his father's
gaze inscrutably, and Morini propped the door, an
automatic swinging unobtrusively in one hand.
"You're clever—like I am," said Surcon.  "You found
me—probably nobody else could have."
</p>

<p>
"Yeh!" agreed Storm.  "But you're like Lew—you
flatter yourself.  You weren't so very difficult, although I
grant you—every time—there was a lot of luck in it.  And
now the game's up.  I've got you.  What're you going to do
about it?"
</p>

<p>
Surcon raised his eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
"Do about it?" he repeated.
</p>

<p>
"You said it!  You're right where I want you.  Hear me!
I'll tell you a home truth you missed through not bringing
me up yourself instead of slinging me into a workhouse
when my mother died.  And that home truth is that there's
one big wad of conceit swollen up above your ears, which
same has just landed you in the fishiest kettle of fish you
ever dived into in your sweet life!  You think you're sitting
on several square miles of velvet.  You've got me, you've
got Miss Hawthorne, and you figure it out you've got every
card in the pack neatly stacked up in your own private mitt.
Guess again!  Maybe you think I'm bluffing.  Guess twice
more!  I never put up a bluff unless I've got an even chance
of pulling out if it's called.  That applies now.  Scotland
Yard have got your little dossier nicely tied up in pink
ribbon, just waiting to travel along to the Public Prosecutor.
And d'you know where you'll be when that dossier makes
its speech?  On the drop, Big Triangle, plumb on the drop!
It's all sealed up, because just now this game happens to be
a private one, and I don't want any policemen sitting in if
I can help it.  But if I don't rock into Scotland Yard by
midnight—the witching hour!—the seals'll be broken, and
that means the hangman'll be earning big money about eight
weeks later.  Which prison'd you fancy?  Pentonville—Wormwood
Scrubs—Holloway—Brixton? ... I expect
it could be arranged."
</p>

<p>
Surcon stared as though he could not believe his ears.
Here was his prisoner talking calmly about executions, and
all the minor troubles that were coming to the Big Triangle,
when all the time Morini had the bead on him, and would
use it at a word!  And, in spite of their terse, slangy
phraseology, Storm's words carried conviction in every
ice-flecked syllable.
</p>

<p>
"When I say I know everything, I'm understanding the
case," Storm went on.  "God Himself couldn't raise a longer
charge sheet than I'm going to hand out to you right now.
We'll take it in tabloids.  All clear?  Then I'll shoot.  One: I
know all about your treble life and your fake deaths.  I
know the beaver who was hoicked out of the Thames last
night was no more Oscar Raegenssen than he was the King
of England.  There never was an Oscar Raegenssen—except
you in fancy dress!  I've proved that, and there's a little
<i>billet-doux</i> from the Home Office pathologist himself to
prove it twice over.  Not to mention Miss Hawthorne's little
piece.  I know why you loved that tin can you called a
safe in your office—I've slid out the shelves and opened up
the dinkiest little cubby-hole any crook could want for a
lie-low.  Why, I've even got your photographs in your two
side-line costumes.  Olaf the Seabird, complete with false
beard, comes into the picture gallery.  Just to show you
there's no ill-feeling, I'll give you a free tip which I'm
afraid you'll never have a chance of using.  Here it is.  If
you must disguise yourself like a dime-novelette detective,
never get in the way of an auto.  You're liable to be knocked
silly, and then you forget to fake up your voice—suppose
anyone's snooping around who knows both of you, that
kind of lets a whole menagerie of cats out of your bag."
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad you allowed the element of luck," remarked
Surcon ironically, although a certain tenseness in his voice
spoilt the effect.
</p>

<p>
Storm flicked some ash from his cigarette.
</p>

<p>
"Share and share alike!  If I was lucky in that, you were
the most doggone lucky crook that ever went on a jag.
Suppose the man detailed to look after your mischief had
been anyone but me?  Think he'd've let you go off smiling?
You get a third free guess!  Only I don't like my relatives
being pushed through traps in execution sheds—it's rotten
bad for the health of the genealogical tree.  Besides, the
papers'd make such a song about it.  <i>Apex Caught By His
Son....  Captain Arden, Police Hero, Gets Father's Death
Warrant</i>....  Thanks all the same, but I don't laugh at
jokes like that!"
</p>

<p>
"And what is your alternative?"
</p>

<p>
"You'll hear that all in good time," said Storm.  "Wait
till I've finished my speech, and don't interrupt.  It's rude.
Right!  Item Two: I know exactly why you sent your cheap
Bowery lead-slingers clinking for the men you did.  I know
why Cardan was killed, and Marker nearly, just like I
know why Hannassay died.  Why, I've seen plate glass less
transparent than you!  The amazing, everlasting, all-fired
and brass-bound miracle is that even a mutt like old fat Teal
didn't have the bracelets on you days and weeks ago.  I
could've done it; except that, as I've explained, it'd've been
embarrassingly public.  A day or two late, you decided it was
time one of your incarnations faded out, and you got away
with it.  You kidded Teal, but you'd have to put up a bit of
whole cloth big enough to cover the world before you got
me guessing!  And I think that tots up to about <i>that</i>.  You
never did anything particularly mysterious.  I saw you stick
up Moraine's, and all the world knows how you wangled
the getaway from Marlborough Street Police Station.  That
was smart, I'll say.  But it didn't matter.  A few little fish
don't matter when there's a whacking great whale jumping
round the net.  And that net is now blocked in with sheet
iron and reënforced concrete tough enough to hold even
you!  D'you doubt me—d'you think I'm bluffing still—or
shall I fire off another tankful?"
</p>

<p>
Surcon said nothing.  As Storm's staccato sentences shot
out their deadly burden, the Apex had receded further and
further into his throne, his jaw thrust out, his pale blue eyes
gleaming like pin-points of azure flame, his whole crouching
position resembling the compression of a wild animal
about to spring.  A crackling electricity had oozed into the
air.  The trace of uneasiness which had been in Surcon's
eyes from the first had grown now into a raging devil of
fear, with hate, desperation, and fury leaping in to join
forces with it and bolster up its fundamental weakness.
Storm's gun-metal grey eyes, drilling without a waver into
his father's blue ones, were hard and pitiless.
</p>

<p>
"The Roman father is an old <i>cliché</i>," continued Storm's
quiet, even, compelling voice—quiet enough it was in actual
physical fact, but the explosive, dominating exclamation
marks stabbed everywhere, relentlessly, through the
superficial placidity.  "But I'm on the road with a new line of
goods: the Roman son!  You can't expect mercy from me.
If you do, you're wasting good day-dreams.  You've killed
men.  One man you killed with your own hands, so Prester
John told me, and I'm inclined to believe him.
Loonies—conceited loonies—like you, don't take much stock of a
human life or two when their own hides are in danger of being
tanned.  I've killed men, too, but not to salve my
head-swelling.  Because you're a murderer you've got to die.
That's the law, and in your particular case I think it's a
damned sound law.  So sound that I'm here to supervise,
personally, the carrying out of the sentence.  Maybe you
thought you were one hell of a bright boy catching me first
shot with that taxi gambit.  Your fourth guess!  A babe in
arms 'd've seen that springe.  It stuck out ten miles!  I let
myself be roped because I didn't know where to find you,
and finding you happened to be the most important act in the
play.  You thought you'd got a sucker, and now you've got
to get it into the ivory over your ears that I'm a red-hot
Tartar.  I'm out gunning for Triangles!  Once you're off the
map I'm going to bounce Lew, and anyone else who horns
in on the bouncing 'll get a free passage to Hell along with
him.  Lew won't be the only one.  I guess the world can
muddle along well enough without Gat either, for that matter,
and there're a few others who'll share the same cemetery."
</p>

<p>
Morini himself was erect now, and the finger which
crooked round the hair-trigger of his automatic quivered
eagerly.  His baby blue eyes were cold.  A man of good
education and more than average intelligence, he was able to
judge exactly how risky every second of Storm's continued
life was.  Morini wasn't fool enough to mistake case-hardened
facts for an empty bluff.
</p>

<p>
"Say the word, Chief," he grated.  "You can't keep him
now.  He knows too much.  If he gets away we're all done,
and he's so slippery you can't guarantee to hold him till he's
dead."
</p>

<p>
"Yeh!  You Gat!"  Storm swung round.  "Shoot and then
get measured for a coffin!  You poor damned goop!  Haven't
you got it into your bony coconut yet that I wouldn't have
come rubing into this party without being sure I was going
out again O.K.?  I've told the Assistant Commissioner that
if I'm not back in his office by twelve to-night he's to open
the envelope I've given him and act on what he finds in it.
By eight o'clock this morning there was a watch on every
port in England.  An armed watch, Gat, with photographs
and descriptions of every big fish in the Triangle pond.
You're on that list!  And you're not a Big Triangle—you'd
want more savvy than you're ever likely to have before you
could disguise yourself so's they wouldn't recognise you.
Take it from uncle!  Try not to be a worse oaf than God
made you, for the love of Mike!  Hear me!  This is the way
you get out of the mulligatawny.  Make your boss see the
game's up.  Once he's gone you stand a chance of staying.
Without him there'd be no Triangle.  It takes a porky slab
of hot dog like he's got to run a bucket shop as big as this.
And once there's no Triangle I might feel kinder and more
loving towards my fellow-men.  Which I don't mind telling
you I don't at this moment.  You've got a gun.  Take your
choice.  Certain death or an even chance!"
</p>

<p>
Then Storm turned his back on the gunman, as though
he were never in doubt of the alternative that gentleman
would select, and faced Surcon once more.
</p>

<p>
"Suppose you kill me," he rapped out, "Teal'll get
you—sure!  Maybe you'd like to hear exactly what evidence Teal's
got to hang you with?  Well, take it in pills again.  One: he
knows now you're Oscar Raegenssen.  Two: I've left him
data enough to prove you're Snooper Brome too!  Chew that
bullet, sweetheart!"
</p>

<p>
Surcon half-rose from his chair, white to the lips.  That
was a shot he had never expected to hear blazed at him.  The
one secret he had thought he had held even against Storm's
acumen had been flourished as certain knowledge with a
calm assurance which staggered him.  It was uncanny.  Yet
he did not lose hold of practical thought.  Almost in the
same flash his brain had seen and seized upon the only
way of escape which now lay open to him, and already he
was whizzing it through his imagination, moulding and
developing it.
</p>

<p>
"That gave you a jolt, I'll bet!" Storm continued.  "I
guessed when I saw you in Raegenssen's house the night I
burgled it.  I was sure when I found you were the man who'd
raked Mattock and Joan Sands into the Triangle.  Gosh! you're
so easy, I wonder you've got this far!  Right.  Let's
get on.  Three: given the first two scoops I've mentioned
they can prove you were the man who directed the sticking
up of Moraine's.  Four: they won't be bothered much
with proving you ordered Miss Hawthorne to be killed by
Morini after she'd seen you that night in Hamilton Place
and your Raegenssen costume.  Five: Raegenssen was the
registered owner of the Billingsgate sawmill.  Bad break of
yours, by the way, forgetting to sign the Deed of Sale in
the Raegenssen handwriting.  I suppose you bought the
place before you'd fixed up what handwriting Oscar was to
have.  Six: Prester John's evidence that you murdered,
with typhus bugs, a man who wanted to know too much
about you.  Seven: having proved you <i>are</i> the Big Triangle,
you're therefore responsible for the deaths of several people
in the Piccadilly Circus beanfeast.  I guess that little
bunch'll weigh heavy enough in the scales to send you to
Hell express, as soon as they can get you convicted and
string you up.  Now crow!"
</p>

<p>
Storm paused and reached for his cigarette case.  He
gave one glance at Morini, and saw that the gunman was
leaning against the door again with his automatic directed
straight at his, Storm's, heart.
</p>

<p>
Storm lighted a cigarette and splintered the match between
his fingers, watching Surcon intently for every sign
of the effect his incisive sentences had had.  Surcon's head
was bent forward, so that he looked at Storm from under
the rim of his prominent brows.
</p>

<p>
"Understand me?" asked Storm softly.  "Got that little
mouthful under your hat?  Is it walking around squeaking
at you? ... It's your cue.  Do you kill me and Miss
Hawthorne—and hang?  Do you lock us up and try making a
bolt for it—and hang?  Or do you walk out into the next
room and shoot yourself without any fuss?  Once upon a
time your family name must've meant something to you.
D'you want the initials on a prison wall, just over an
inconspicuous grave, and your own life history minutely recorded
in every book on crime that's written from now onwards?
Or have you got a spark of decency left in you?  Have you
got guts enough to stay dead like a gentleman?  It's your
shout.  Pay up, and nobody'll ever see the bill.  Don't square
it my way, and you go to Tophet through a mud bath."
</p>

<p>
It seemed for a moment as if Surcon was searching his
son's face for any trace of relenting, but Storm's features
were set in a granite, ruthless, inexorable mask.  And then
the burning rage crept back into Surcon's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Are you much better than a parricide?" demanded Surcon
fiercely, literally shaking with passion.  "Isn't your idea
just to shelve the responsibility for the act—and be the
cause of it just the same?"
</p>

<p>
"Put it that way, if you like," returned Storm icily.  "It
happens to satisfy what conscience I've got.  And since I
hold the whip hand, what I say goes!"
</p>

<p>
The effrontery of his manner passed over the heads of
his hearers.  They were becoming inured to it.  His crisp,
self-possessed manner had ladled them out such a succession
of incredible blows that their senses were growing
numb.  He coolly usurped the position of dictator, when all
the time he was at their mercy—domineered, bullied,
insulted, mocked them until their wrath towered over him in
great boiling waves.  And through it all he smiled serenely,
punching home the facts he had to deliver with the efficient
force of a piledriver.  He didn't play his part as by rights
an unarmed prisoner should have played it—didn't give
a hoot for the superiority of their position—didn't give a
damn for their spleen.  One might have thought he had
the entire British Army drawn up in a hollow square round
the house in Buckingham Gate, just waiting to rush in if
anybody started rough-housing.  Storm was his nickname,
and now they had some idea how he had earned it.  He was
Storm.  It didn't count with him that several unpleasantly
large hornet's nests were jazzing round his ears.  He played
out his lone hand with a blithe confidence they couldn't
cope with.
</p>

<p>
And he had got under Morini's skin.
</p>

<p>
"You've got to give him his, Chief," snapped Gat.  "He
said the instructions to the bulls won't be opened till
midnight—that gives us more than twelve hours to make our
getaway.  We can go down to one of the Channel seaside
places and go off in small boats.  We ought to be able to
make the French coast.  It's risky, but it's been done before.
He may be your son, but you needn't see him shot.  I'll do it.
You can't cling on to that stunt of locking him away—he
knows too much."
</p>

<p>
"You said it!" murmured Storm.  "And I know a whole
lot more than I've spilled this morning.  Shall I go on?  If
you'd like another dose, you're welcome!  You moron!
Hear me, Gat!  Don't you think I'd seen that getaway scheme
years before it ever penetrated your maggoty skull?  Keep
on hoping!  Why, you cheap C<sub>3</sub> cretin, by this time the
whole Channel Squadron and the North Sea Fleet are
ranging up and down looking for just such an easy getaway.
Think again, Gat, and think fast!"
</p>

<p>
"I'll give you my answer, Captain Arden," said Surcon.
"Morini, bring Miss Hawthorne here."
</p>

<p>
As the door closed, Storm sized up his father.  Surcon
seemed to bulk bigger than ever, huddled up in that ornate
throne; and Storm knew that, immensely strong as he was,
he would stand no chance against such a giant of a man.
Surcon must have read his thoughts, for a bitter smile
touched the thin lips.
</p>

<p>
"No hope that way, Captain Arden.  You get your
strength from me, and the tree is bigger than the branch."
</p>

<p>
Storm smiled back, and for a second a ray of humanity
relieved the stern set of his face.
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes you appeal to me—your nerve's nearly as
good as mine," he said.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, Surcon's action gave him furiously to
think.  The Apex hadn't reacted according to schedule.
Somewhere up that enigmatic sleeve was a trump card,
and Storm had an uneasy suspicion that he could guess what
it was without much chance of error.  As he had said, he
never put up a bluff without having an even chance of
pulling through if it crashed.  That even chance had suddenly
tumbled down the market to about three to one against.
And yet, for all that momentary misgiving, he never
changed his calm, arrogant poise.  No need to show your
bluff till all the other cards are on the table, if you can
avoid it...
</p>

<p>
Surcon had put on a black silk handkerchief by way of
a mask, and was pulling his hat down over his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"A slight precaution, though I doubt its necessity," he
explained, and then Susan was outside the door.
</p>

<p>
Storm recognised her footsteps, but Morini came in
alone.  Affecting lack of interest, Storm heard every word
of conversation which passed between Morini and his Chief,
and Kit's brow furrowed for a second as he endeavoured
to account for what Mecklen had seen.
</p>

<p>
And then Susan was in the room, and a little of Storm's
grimness relaxed as he heard her gasp of surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo, kid," he drawled cheerfully.  "Sleep well?  I hear
Lew was a naughty boy last night.  Don't worry—I'm going
to strafe ole Lew very soon!"
</p>

<p>
"How did you get here?"  She had taken her cue from
him, and was smiling, playing up gloriously to him.  "Don't
say they got you after all?"
</p>

<p>
"I think not," Storm said carefully.  "The general
impression at the moment is that I've got <i>them</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Surcon's smile distorted his tight mouth into a cryptic
grimace.
</p>

<p>
"Morini—fetch all the men who are in the building.
Make sure Mecklen comes."
</p>

<p>
Once again Gat departed.
</p>

<p>
Storm stepped off the daïs and went to Susan.  His back
was to Surcon, which fact gave him an opportunity to wink
encouragingly at her.  His grin was cheerfulness itself, but
she did not like the metallic light which lay behind his
expressive eyes.  He took her arm and led her back to the
platform, and she thrilled to the cool steadiness of his hand.
</p>

<p>
Men began to file into the room, taking their places at
the benches without speaking.  Clearly the vanity of the
Triangle had made him summon such portentous assemblies
before, for the men moved like a well-trained company of
soldiers at Church Parade.  Storm had time to be amused.
</p>

<p>
"Mecklen!"
</p>

<p>
All the men were in their seats, and the Apex spoke out
resonantly.  Lew came forward sheepishly.
</p>

<p>
"Take that girl!"
</p>

<p>
Two men in the front jumped up and caught Susan by
the arms.  They hurried her on to the platform, against the
huge silver triangle, and began to tie her wrists to two of
the corners, so that the base ran across her back.  She fought
desperately, striking out at their faces with her clenched
fists, but with a couple of sulphurous ejaculations as the
first blows got home they closed in and gripped her arms,
holding her helpless.
</p>

<p>
Morini was standing beside Storm, his automatic swinging
ostentatiously at the "ready" in case of any attempt
to go to the girl's assistance.  But Storm made no move to
attack.  He stepped back, folding his arms so that the hands
came in the armholes of his coat, and under cover of the
cloth he was working away at the sleeves of his
bullet-proof vest.
</p>

<p>
And all the time he cursed silently, although his face
never betrayed his kindling fury.  He'd been caught!  His
precious plot had had a link in it so weak it wouldn't have
carried an emaciated guinea-pig, and he'd never seen the
flaw.  He'd plumbed the uttermost profundities of multitude;
he'd attained dizzy pinnacles of boobery; he'd wallowed
in oceans of sublime insanity.  To Bill Kennedy that
morning he had confessed that in the past he'd been a mug,
and he'd sworn he was going to atone for it—instead of
which he'd rolled out of an ordinary frying-pan into a fire
that was more like a roaring blast furnace....
</p>

<p>
Susan was bound, now, and the two who had done it
were back in their pews, rubbing bruised shins and
muttering luridly.
</p>

<p>
"You have a gun, Mecklen," said the Apex.  "You were
told to kill Miss Hawthorne, and you disobeyed.  There is
still time."
</p>

<p>
Lew took his revolver from his pocket and looked from
it to his leader.  Brute as he was, there was something ghastly
about such a cold-blooded murder which he found hard to
stomach, and he frowned doubtfully, as though unwilling
to comprehend.  Surcon returned the look with a remorseless
determination gleaming in his blue eyes.  Slowly Mecklen
raised the gun....
</p>

<p>
"One moment!"  The Apex turned to Storm, and that
deep, sonorous intonation filled the room like a chant of
doom.  "You may be less sure of yourself now, Captain
Arden.  It is now my turn to offer you a choice....  Take
Miss Hawthorne and go free to report at Scotland Yard.
Resign.  And then go abroad for three months and forget
all about the Alpha Triangle.  Refuse those terms——"
</p>

<p>
"And——?" prompted Storm, very quietly.
</p>

<p>
"And Mecklen will not be disobedient a second time."
</p>

<p>
Storm looked at the girl.  She was standing quite still
now, her head erect, and a light of proud defiance in her
eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Tell him to go to blazes!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice rang out with bell-like clarity, and there was
not a hint of faltering in it.  Storm swallowed a lump that
had come into his throat.  His head bowed, as if in the agony
of making his decision, but all the while his hands fumbled
away swiftly and surely at his arms.  Another second....
</p>

<p>
At last he raised his head and his cold eyes swept from
Mecklen to Morini, from Morini to Ezra Surcon, <i>alias</i> Bulsaid.
</p>

<p>
"Sure thing—you great little wonderful kid!" he cried,
and his hands leapt into view with lightning-like rapidity.
</p>

<p>
Three shots reverberated as one.  The men in their chairs,
watching, spell-bound, saw Mecklen clutch his chest, sway,
and sag to the floor with a long sighing groan.  They saw
Morini reel back, clawing convulsively at a jaw which
Storm's heavy-calibre bullet had smashed and all but torn
from its sockets.  They saw Storm himself, struck over the
breast-bone by Morini's fractional-second-late shot,
stagger and then, miraculously recover himself....
</p>

<p>
And then Storm was on the daïs, shielding Susan with
his body.  One gun-laden hand, resting on his hip, roved
from face to face of the men still sitting as though paralysed,
in the body of the room; the other focused on the Apex.
</p>

<p>
"There's my answer!  <i>Now</i> crow, you second-hand
Gorgonzolas!" he mocked them.
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII
<br><br>
MR. TEAL BUTTS IN
</h3>

<p>
The Assistant Commissioner did not leave immediately
after Storm had gone.  Instead Bill Kennedy and Mr. Teal
sat in the Albany talking over many things.  And it was when
Mr. Kennedy was taking up his gloves preparatory to
departure that the telephone bell rang.  The Assistant
Commissioner took up the receiver.
</p>

<p>
"Is that Captain Arden?" asked a voice.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Bill, to save trouble.
</p>

<p>
"I'm speaking from St. George's Hospital.  We've got a
man here who wants to speak to you urgently.  I'm afraid
he's dying—they picked him up in Buckingham Gate last
night with eight inches of knife in his lungs.  He's only just
recovered consciousness."
</p>

<p>
"What's his name?"
</p>

<p>
"Sands."
</p>

<p>
Bill Kennedy whistled softly.
</p>

<p>
"Any idea what he wants to say?"
</p>

<p>
"Not much.  He'll only speak to you personally.  But he
keeps muttering something about a triangle and a girl."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there in eight minutes, laddie," Kennedy stated
crisply.
</p>

<p>
As he replaced the instrument he saw that Teal was
struggling off the sofa.
</p>

<p>
"Never," said Teal solemnly, "never in my life have I
missed anything that was going on worth being present at.
If you try to make me break that record, sir, I shall resign
this morning.  Don't say anything about my shoulder,
because there's no bones broken—it's just a flesh wound I'd
rather be without, but it doesn't mean I'm going to be tied
down in a bath-chair."
</p>

<p>
Bill Kennedy was an excellent judge of time and space.
Exactly eight minutes after he had hung up the receiver he
was standing beside the death bed of Birdie Sands, that
funny, wizened little man.  Teal was with him, and they
were hidden from the rest of the ward by the screens which
in hospitals are placed about the beds of those whose hours
are numbered.
</p>

<p>
The whizzer looked up with a wry smile.  He was pale
from loss of blood, but in no pain.  His breath came in long,
slow, wheezing draughts which scarcely stirred his shallow
chest.  The clear luminosity of the Beyond was in his
eyes, and a strange serenity had smoothed out the wrinkles
on his pinched face.
</p>

<p>
"Where's ... Arden?" he asked, faintly.
</p>

<p>
Bill Kennedy sat down on the bed, Teal remaining erect.
</p>

<p>
"Captain Arden's gone to look for Miss Hawthorne,"
said Bill.  "He wanted to settle the Triangle alone and we
had to promise not to interfere unless he failed.  I don't
know how he was going to set about it, but he had some
plan or other in his head."
</p>

<p>
Birdie was silent.  Then:
</p>

<p>
"I never met 'im," he whispered.  "But they s'y 'e was a
good busy.  Listen, Kennedy."
</p>

<p>
Sands raised himself on one elbow.  The effort caused
him a fit of hoarse coughing, but he shook off Bill's
restraining hand impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Yer gotta brike yer promise.  Not only fer 'is sike.
There's the 'Awthorne girl.  She's there—in that 'ouse in
Buckingham Gate.  They'll kill 'er, sure.  Or worse....  That
Lew's a swine ... blarst 'im.  Dunno w'y, but I 'ate Lew
... poison!  More'n Morini, even—an' Morini knifed me.
Throws knives like a bloke in a circus....  Oh, yer needn't
shike yer 'ead.  I know....  I'm not much ter look at—not
much ter think of—I'm just a cheap crook, an' a little one
at that.  But I 'ad a sister once....  Joan....  She's married
ter Mattock—strite an' proper, swelp me.  She's clean.
Teal—yer was always an honest dick—get 'er out of the
mess—ter make a man 'appy yer won't never see agine?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mr. Teal.
</p>

<p>
Birdie pawed weakly at his throat, then held out a thin
hand.  Gravely Inspector Teal took it in a firm grip and
held it for a moment.
</p>

<p>
There was a silence.  And then Birdie spoke again.
Quickly and breathlessly, his voice growing a shade
stronger, for the end was very near.
</p>

<p>
"Get ter that 'ouse.  Black 'ouse.  Now.  Wiv all the flatties
yer can lay yer 'ands on.  No time ter lose.  Arden can't never
win—'e don't know what I know.  The Triangle's got a card
Arden'll never beat.  There's a tunnel—another blow-up,
an' it's bigger'n Piccadilly!  <i>'Urry!</i> ... There's no other
w'y ... ter get 'is girl ... out....  Never mind yer promise....
Will yer go?"
</p>

<p>
Birdie clutched Bill's sleeve earnestly; and, quietly, Bill
nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Then go!  Ain't no ... time....  Don't wait fer me—I
alw'ys lived alone....  S'pose I can die alone ... I'd
rather...."  A shrill, feeble cackle of laughter broke eerily
from the dry lips.  "Oh, yer damned Triangle!  I got
yer—Birdie, little crook Birdie....  An' I got yer ... smashed
yer!... Blarst... yar!" ...
</p>

<p>
And then the voice fell so low that Bill Kennedy had to
lay his ear almost on Birdie's mouth to catch the gasping
words.
</p>

<p>
"Put on the lights....  I'm afraid of ... the dark...."  Birdie's
hand went groping for Kennedy's fingers.  "Joan
... Joan ... Birdie's goin'....  Never was much use to yer
... But yer ... all ... right ... <i>Joan!</i> ... It's cold....  Kiss
me...."
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
"We'll get in through the mews—most of these old
houses have back entrances that way," said Teal.
</p>

<p>
Unostentatiously a cordon had ringed round the gaunt,
sinister house in Buckingham Gate, and the mews behind
was thronged with armed men whose rubber-soled shoes
had made no sound on the cobbles.  Bill Kennedy was in
charge of the men in Buckingham Gate itself, and Teal was
left to direct the opening of the attack.
</p>

<p>
A minute study of the tire tracks showed that, although
there were six lock-ups along the west side of the mews, all
the cars which had recently passed in and out of the garage
had entered and left by one particular door.  Teal made a
careful examination of the lock, and also tested the
resistance to a steady, cautious push.
</p>

<p>
"One bar across the centre," was his expert verdict.
</p>

<p>
Then he drew up his men and gave them their instructions.
There was an odd furtiveness about the proceedings—the
thirty men mustered in the mews might have been
conspirators meeting at dead of night to hatch some nefarious
plot, instead of burly, stolid plain-clothes men with nothing
more sensational about them than the police automatic and
truncheons with which they were armed.  Even Teal, an
unemotional law-enforcing machine, found himself speaking
in hushed tones, although their danger lay far more in
being seen than in being overheard.  Nevertheless, all the
men were pressed close up against the garage doors on the
west side, to minimise the risk of being observed by
anyone who chanced to look out of one of the upper windows.
</p>

<p>
"... And if any perishing sinner falls over his own feet
this time, like one adjective noun did in Billingsgate not
so long ago," Mr. Teal concluded, with whole seas of
incandescent vitriol bubbling up in his measured delivery, "I
promise him he won't only wish he'd never been born—he'll
pray that there's no such thing as reincarnation, when
I've finished with him!"
</p>

<p>
With which horrific prognostication Mr. Teal moved off
to take up his position.
</p>

<p>
He glanced round, and made certain that the twelve men
whom he had detailed to assist in the breaking in of the
door were stationed ready on his heels; and then he took a
Smith-Wesson from his hip pocket and thumbed back the
hammer.
</p>

<p>
"Ready?"
</p>

<p>
The question ripped out in sibilant warning, and a
second later things happened.
</p>

<p>
Teal's revolver thundered, and the heavy bullets shredded
the lock completely out of existence.  Simultaneously,
Central Inspector Teal and his twelve good men and true
hurled their total three-quarter ton of bone and brawn
against the barred door.  And, with one prolonged,
rending, splinting crash, the door simply was not....
</p>

<p>
They burst panting into the garage, and might have come
to a check there among the miscellaneous assortment of
trucks and cars but for the spectacled man who happened
precisely at that moment to be emerging from the secret
panel behind the tire cupboard.  In an instant he was whisking
back, like a startled mouse which has peeped out of its
hole and looked straight into the eyes of a hungry cat; but
Mr. Teal, moving at a rate of knots which his weight and
inertia made to seem positively supernatural, crossed the
concrete flooring like a whiff of smoke.  He reached out a
long arm and grabbed the horn-rimmed gentleman before
that blushing violet could obscure himself behind the
closing slide.
</p>

<p>
"Carl, darling," hissed Teal, "why did you leave your
happy home?  And how's Mr. Nitrogen Trichloride this
merry morning?"
</p>

<p>
Before Mr. Schwesen could utter a suitable reply, Teal
had yanked him halfway across the place and smothered
him in a stifling bear-hug.  And thereafter, while practised
hands clicked gyves upon floundering wrists, the eminent
Austrian chemist found it necessary to reserve all his energies
for the task of avoiding suffocation.  It was all over in
a trice, and, even as the remainder of the thirty poured in
through the broken door, Mr. Schwesen was on his way to
the police van which waited in Petty France.
</p>

<p>
The fat being thoroughly in the fire by now, speed
became the order of the day.  Headed by Teal, whose injured
shoulder was by this time troubling him far more than he
would ever have admitted, the constables rushed through
the cupboard and down the short tunnel to the cellars.  Two
men were left to guard the end of the passage, and the rest
raced up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
The hall was deserted.
</p>

<p>
Moving as silently as they could, the detectives opened
each door in turn, finding large volumes of vacancy at
every attempt.  Two doors only were left for investigation
when Teal, issuing his orders in a hoarse whisper, detached
half his force to make a round of the upstairs rooms and
guard against an escape, similar to the getaway the Triangle
had brought off in Billingsgate, by means of an opening
into an adjoining house.  At the same time, the front door
was unbolted without noise, and Bill Kennedy, together
with some of those who were watching Buckingham Gate,
came in soundlessly.
</p>

<p>
And then Teal silently turned the handle of the first of
the two remaining ground-floor doors.  A dark, narrow
corridor fronted him, and he signalled for only six men to
accompany him.  There was no window or light of any sort
in the runway, and when they had gone twenty paces the
faint light which filtered in from the gloomy hall ceased to
be of any assistance.  As quietly as he could manage, Teal
kindled a match, and found that the passage terminated in a
dead end, the only outlet being a low door which opened off
on the right.
</p>

<p>
Teal laid a cautious hand on the knob, and suddenly a
tremor ran up his spine, for the handle was turning of
itself under his light grasp....
</p>

<p>
Breathlessly he mouthed his men back out of the passage,
and flattened himself against the blind wall so that the
opening door would hide him from whoever came out.  The oak
swung back by inches, nervously, and it was nearly half a
minute before it closed again and Teal saw a stocky, crouching
shape silhouetted against the nimbus of twilight which
came from the hall.
</p>

<p>
Holding his breath, Teal leapt silently as any pard.  His
big hand tightened round the man's throat before so much
as a whimper could disturb the stillness, and Teal lifted the
furtive one bodily from the ground and padded down the
corridor with him.
</p>

<p>
"There's a long, long jail a-waiting—for you—dearie!"
</p>

<p>
Teal's voice stole to the man's ear drums in a husky
pianissimo, and Teal's ungentle fingers forced a scared face
round to meet the light.
</p>

<p>
And then Inspector Teal, that sedate apostle of tranquillity,
let out an involuntary gasp of amazement, for the
man he carried was Joe Blaythwayt!
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap28"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVIII
<br><br>
LAST ROUND
</h3>

<p>
Storm's face was bleak, but his two guns might have been
gripped in vises mounted on rock-based foundations for all
the quivering they showed.  He thought that the colossal
impact of Morini's bullet must have broken a rib, for,
although no revolver in the world loaded a charge heavy
enough to penetrate that wonderful steel-chain armour, the
imperviousness of it was no defence against the sheer shock
of the blow.  Every breath he took stabbed an excruciating
pang through his lungs.  Yet his gay, reckless fighting smile
was on his lips; and, when he spoke again, his voice was still
deadly even, still rippling so deceptively smoothly over
jagged slivers of quartz.
</p>

<p>
"Free Tip Number Two—straight from the stable—Big
Triangle: When you flick out the king of trumps, never
start in gloating until you're dam' sure the other man hasn't
got the ace tucked away in his fist some place!  This is where
you look round for your umpteenth guess!  All of you.  And
listen—just bat so much as an eyelid, one of you frogricked
horse thieves, and you'll find out where fleas go when
they've dined off a dope-soaked suicide!  Anybody care to
try it?  No?  Nobody curious?  I'll say you're a crew of
unenterprising sons of a Port Mahon baboon!  And I'll bet less
than twelve hours ago you were all scratching each other's
backs and telling yourselves what a tough lot of
hell-for-leather fire-eaters you were.  Je-rusalem!  You make me
tired.  What about it—huh?  Can't you even raise one lone
cuss-word among the lot of you?  Tough?  Gosh!  I'd like to
have the whole boiling of you aboard a good old-fashioned
windjammer with a hard-case bucko mate to help me teach
you real toughness."
</p>

<p>
They said nothing.  One or two were on their feet, but
even they remained safely motionless, having apparently
no wish to court the certain death which lurked in the breech
of the automatic that roamed so hopefully from head to
head.  And Storm went on baiting them, playing for a few
minutes' grace in which to recover slightly from the stunning
results of the shot he had taken and to formulate some
scheme for getting Susan loose from the ropes without
exposing himself to attack.
</p>

<p>
"You poor wet fish!"  The tang of his whiplash contempt
bit tellingly into the raw ends of their vanity with every
measured stroke.  "A suckling could boss a gang of white-livered
slum rats like you!  Hold up London itself for fifteen
million?  Take an expert's advice and go off and practice on
hen-rabbits till you get stringy enough to hold up a hysterical
old woman for fifteen cents and get away with it.  I'm
disappointed.  I'm a plain ornery fighting machine—I'll
fight anyone, any time, any place, and any old how—and I
thought I'd landed the goods when I picked on you.  Instead
of which I find I'm bullyragging a grown-up Sunday
School.  This is my second guess!  After grubstaking a stumer
like this, I'm going fishing for tadpoles next time I feel
bored.  It's more exciting, and a heap more dangerous."
</p>

<p>
He had them writhing under the scourge, knew that
every iota of the smart sank right in where it was meant to
go—but still they stayed their hands.  Tenacity of life, for
the moment, held them at bay.  Only for the moment.  Storm
knew that it couldn't last.  It was only a question of time
before someone gave the cue for the next movement of the
ballet, and that time wasn't likely to be over-long elapsing.
Very soon they must realise their strength, just as he
realised his weakness.  He was alone in the house, and no one
knew where he was.  No rescue party had been arranged for
at the critical moment.  If they attacked him in one
concerted mob, he might kill half a dozen of them if he were
lucky, but after that they'd have their revenge.  And Susan
would be left to face the final racket....
</p>

<p>
Zero hour.
</p>

<p>
Already he had pondered every detail of the room.  As far
as he knew, there was only the one exit—the door through
which he had entered.  There might be others—in fact, there
probably were—but those hangings which surrounded the
room were as bad as a fog.  There wasn't a hope of gaining
sufficient time to poke round all the four walls until one
spotted the necessary bolt-hole.  Therefore....
</p>

<p>
"Big Triangle, this is a private bus," Storm said.  "Get
off!  Go and play with your friends in the audience."
</p>

<p>
One gun motioned him away from the platform, and then
returned to aim on Surcon's heart.  The Apex hesitated, but
there was a flaring menace in Storm's grey eyes which
brooked no refusal.
</p>

<p>
"And keep those hands of yours miles away from
everything!" added Storm.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the Apex stepped off the daïs and walked towards
one wall in the body of the room.  Then Storm dropped one
gun into his coat pocket, stooped swiftly, and gained
possession of his knife.  Backing in front of the silver sign to
which Susan was bound, he felt for the cords which held
her.  Once found, a couple of rapid slashes, and she was
free....
</p>

<p>
His luck had held—incredibly—but he had no leisure to
waste on applauding his good fortune.  Quick as light, he
slipped the automatic from his pocket again and placed the
knife in her hand; and even as he did so he saw that the
pent-up torrent was on the point of breaking.  The men
were looking to the Apex, waiting tensely, keyed up for the
signal to let fly.  Storm could almost see the squall careering
up to engulf him.  Only a few seconds more—if that—but
Heaven grant him the respite of those few seconds!
</p>

<p>
"Big Triangle!"  Arden's voice clipped out again, and
this time he glutted into it every fierce, rampaging demon
of savage command he could concentrate on the words.
"You're my hostage.  Freeze on to that!  It's no bluff this
journey!  The first man who makes a threatening movement'll
finish it after you're dead!  I've got you covered, and
I never miss.  Look!"
</p>

<p>
And then Storm diced everything on an even chance.
Either his action would win the few seconds' cowed stillness
he needed, or it would be as a spark to the over-dried
tinder which was only waiting for its opportunity to blaze
up and wipe him off the earth.
</p>

<p>
He made the gamble without a flicker of an eye.
</p>

<p>
Two vicious little tongues of orange flame spat out of his
automatics, and the two shots rattled like the sharp rat-tat
of a drum.
</p>

<p>
And Storm was sidling towards the door with Susan following
him.  And Ezra Surcon had sprung back a pace, clapping
shaky hands to his ears, for Storms' bullets had grazed
under the lobes like two hot searing irons scraped across the
skin.
</p>

<p>
"That'll show you whether I've handled gats before!"
Storm challenged, frostily as a Siberian zephyr.  "And next
time it won't be fancy shooting you'll see demonstrated.
Now think again, all of you, before you cut up crusty with
me!"
</p>

<p>
Susan's hand was already on the door, and in the tingling
silence Storm heard her catch her breath.  The next
moment she was whispering in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"There're men moving about outside—creeping around.
I can hear them."
</p>

<p>
"Hell!"
</p>

<p>
The word murmured almost inaudibly in Storm's throat.
More mess!  When he had heard the Apex summon to that
room all the men who were in the house, he had naturally
assumed that the order would be obeyed.  With the only exit
he knew ruled out, they were in the most ghastly blind alley
two people could have strayed into.  And once again the
effect of his arrogant threatening was wearing off—more
quickly than before, now that the men he was dealing with
had grasped their own danger as well as the precariousness
of his position.  They would never let him get away if they
could possibly prevent it, even though they ran the risk of
being shot down in the attack.  Each one of them would hope
to be lucky and escape the few rounds Kit could loose off
before they reached him, and each would be aware of the
havoc which would be running amok once he got in touch
with Scotland Yard.  The Apex most of all.  Surcon's hands
were coming slowly down from his face, and a fiendish
lustre burned in his pale blue eyes.  His voice rang out
suddenly, breaking in on the sizzling intensity of Storm's
thought.
</p>

<p>
"Wait, Captain Arden!"
</p>

<p>
Surcon, too, could move like an arrow.  And the shock
of Susan's discovery had taken that last, infinitesimal
perfection of keenness off Storm's alert brain—such an all but
imperceptible blunting, yet great enough to make an
incalculable difference.
</p>

<p>
Ezra Surcon had flung up his hands and parted the hangings
behind him.  They saw that screwed to the wall was a
small switchboard of porcelain from which protruded two
six-inch levers of ebonite.  And the Apex had one of these
firmly gripped in each of his upraised hands.
</p>

<p>
"Now listen to me," he shouted.  "Haven't forgotten
Piccadilly Circus, have you?  Well, try to imagine twice that
amount of NCl<sub>3</sub> under—<i>Buckingham Palace</i>!  Why else
should I make my headquarters here?  There's a tunnel from
the cellars—or was, before the explosive was tamped in—and
the Palace isn't far.  The stuff's packed in huge blocks
of ice, but when I pull down this switch it'll close a circuit,
and this heat's a network of platinum wires among the
charge.  Shoot me, and the weight of my body'll pull down
the switch.  I'll prove to you I'm not bluffing, either.  See the
other switch?  That connects with a tiny tube of nitrogen
trichloride upstairs.  Show you——"
</p>

<p>
He dragged down the second lever.  From over their heads
came a dull, ear-numbing thud.  The ceiling cracked, and
little fragments of plaster broke away and crumbled to the
floor....
</p>

<p>
The explosion, small as Surcon had said the charge was,
shook the house.  Came a hoarse exclamation outside the
door, and someone barked out two words ... then, the
muffled patter of feet stumbling up the stairs....  The
Apex looked drawn and haggard suddenly, and an almost
childlike puzzlement crept into his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"What was that?"
</p>

<p>
"More of your friends, I expect," remarked Storm
coolly, for he had recognised the voice outside in the hall.
"Susan, get the door open—hustle!"
</p>

<p>
"It's locked!" screamed Surcon.  A mad triumph shook
him.  "Locked—locked—locked!  No escape!  Get after him,
men!  <i>Get on—get on—what're you waiting for?</i>  Watch,
Captain Arden!"
</p>

<p>
Storm saw the knuckles of Surcon's right hand whiten
over the lever they still held.  Storm blazed away—carelessly,
with one gun, into the ugly surge of men who hurled
themselves at him; accurately, with the other, at Ezra
Surcon.  And Storm thanked all his pagan gods that his boast
had been a sound one—that he never missed.  Three bullets
sped like three crashing thunderbolts into Surcon's right
wrist, smashing flesh and bone and sinew to a spurting
crimson pulp.
</p>

<p>
Storm saw the Apex drop his hand, and then Captain
Christopher Arden, trouble-hunter, was slap in the middle
of as big a slice of trouble as any Hotspur could desire.
With two empty guns clenched in his hands to add weight
to his blows, he was battling for dear life against a horde
of raging maniacs who, fortunately for him, were too
closely packed to be able to use their weapons without risk
of killing each other, were hampered by their own numbers
... men who used tooth and talon like wild beasts
... men, like animals, thirsting for blood....
</p>

<p>
No giant of legend could have stood up to that terrible
onslaught for more than three minutes.  Human muscle and
nerve, however willing, were physically incapable of
sustaining the fearful pace of such a fight.  Storm slogged away
with the powerful precision of the fighting machine he had
called himself, but he felt his strength going and the <i>sog</i>
of his sledge-hammer blows into contorted faces growing
less potent with every punch.  His fists catapulted out from
all angles—he still smiled, but grimly—and all the time he
knew it couldn't last.  A red mist shot with eddying whirls
of black and silver swam before his eyes nauseatingly; his
chest was a hive of toiling agony; he wondered wearily how
long it could last.  But he never let up.  He knew he was
going out, knew that his hour had struck ... a great and
worthy end to so wildly glorious a life.  He knew no
fear—only a strange, primitive exaltation.
</p>

<p>
Battered, bruised, and torn, thereafter he fought on in
silence.  He knew that he had been fighting for no more
than half a minute, yet in that short space he felt as if he
had lived through an eternity.  As though separated from his
body, his mind stood out clear as a crystal globe in sunlight.
He could think coldly, calmly, and work out exactly how
much longer he could keep going.  Another half-minute,
perhaps, and then—<i>finis</i>....
</p>

<p>
And then a new voice broke into the tempest.  A familiar
voice, preternaturally excited.  Teal!  How had Teal got in?
Had he found the secret entrance, or broken through the
locked door?  Funny, that—Storm hadn't expected rescue.
All the odds had been against Teal getting in before it was
too late.  But it was Teal's booming bass all right—no doubt
about that—and Teal himself, ploughing like a cruiser
towards him.
</p>

<p>
"Hold on, Captain Arden! ... Hold on! ... Come
on, boys!"
</p>

<p>
And Storm managed to cheer back:
</p>

<p>
"Atta baby, Teal!  Give 'em Hell!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap29"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIX
<br><br>
BREAK AWAY
</h3>

<p>
They got him away.  Somehow, after a second eternity of
effort, he was free of the swaying, cursing throng.  Leaning
against the wall, panting, drawing a bleeding, aching hand
across his filming eyes.  Susan clutching his hand, straining
herself against him.  Teal's arm around his shoulders,
supporting him.
</p>

<p>
Out of the Valley of the Shadow....  Homeric....
</p>

<p>
Men were still pouring through a door which had been
knocked off its hinges, struggling in scattered knots to
overpower the last stand of the Triangle.  The Apex himself was
not among them.
</p>

<p>
"The Big Triangle!" gasped Storm.  "Teal—get him!
Black mask ... he's gone!"
</p>

<p>
"It's all right," soothed Teal clumsily, and Storm shook
him off with an impatient shrug.
</p>

<p>
"It's all wrong!  You've got to get him!  Tear down the
hangings!  There must be another exit."
</p>

<p>
Teal obeyed, Storm helping as best he could.  Other
detectives were at work immediately.
</p>

<p>
And so they saw that at the end of the room where the
dais was, the curtains hung three feet off the wall, leaving
a hidden alley at the end of which was a door.  Teal was the
first through, and when he saw where he was he nearly
choked, for it was the narrow passage where he had caught
Blaythwayt.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the hall they found it deserted, for
every man on the job was by then crowded into the throne
room to help the fight.  In a sudden flash of intuition Teal
raced for the cellar stairs, and, as he opened the door, he
distinctly heard the clatter of shoes on stone slabs die away.
</p>

<p>
"Through the garage!"
</p>

<p>
They could be but a little way behind.  Teal pounded down
the steps, with Storm hard on his heels.  Even as they reached
the cellar level, they caught a glimpse of a tall figure
sprinting down the gloom of the short passage towards the now
open panel in the tire cupboard.  Storm kept up with Teal
in that hectic chase—how, he never knew.  He was tired unto
death, but a superhuman will-power kept him going when
every fibre of his body shrieked for rest.  And they were in
the tunnel when they heard the roar of a racing car's exhaust.
</p>

<p>
<i>An instant later a second exhaust stammered into life!</i>
</p>

<p>
Storm remembered the two silver racing cars he had seen
when they brought him into the garage in the taxi.
</p>

<p>
"Who in glory's that?" Teal's amazed ejaculation as he
ran.
</p>

<p>
Then they burst into the garage itself.  The first car was
already in the mews, and they were in time to see the tail of
the second disappear round the smashed door of the lock-up.
There was no chance of starting up another of the cars
to follow in pursuit—even assuming that one of those
which were left would be capable of overtaking either of
the first two lean, speedy super-cars, which was unlikely.
Teal and Storm sprinted down the mews, Teal dragging his
revolver from his pocket as he went.
</p>

<p>
They saw the hinder car turn right as they entered the
mews, and as they reached the end they saw it skid round
into Buckingham Gate, with the driver hunched up over the
wheel in an attitude of desperate concentration.
</p>

<p>
Then they were in Buckingham Gate themselves, and,
standing on the kerb, they witnessed a play which might
have been lifted from a sensational movie scenario.
</p>

<p>
The first car had a lead of about fifty yards, and was
increasing it.  And then they heard a hideous, clanking grind.
The driver had missed his gears.  The racking, tortured
noise went on, mingling with the deafening drone of the
racing engine, as the masked man strove frenziedly to force
the cogs to engage.  And while he did so he turned in the
seat and they saw a gun in his hand.  The second car was
gaining ground rapidly now, and then the revolver cracked,
and the second driver's cap went spinning.  Again the
masked man fired—twice—and Storm and Teal heard the
whine of the bullets passing over their heads.
</p>

<p>
"Je-rusalem—he's shooting at us!" Storm exclaimed,
and began running towards the two cars.
</p>

<p>
The leading racer was slowing down, for the almost
continuous grating which came from it showed that the masked
man had still failed to get in gear again.  The distance
between the two speedsters was lessening swiftly—twenty
yards ... fifteen ... ten ... and the second car moving
like a streak of light.  For the last time the masked man
fired, practically at point-blank range, but although his
bullet might have stopped a charging man it could not stop a
charging car.  And charging the second car was, heading
straight for the decelerating racer.
</p>

<p>
And the pursuing car must have been travelling at over
sixty miles an hour....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
Teal and Storm came up some minutes after the collision.
A mangled wreck of twisted machinery and rent and
crushed aluminium—that was all.  With two bodies jammed
in the ruins, weltering in a spreading pool of petrol tinted
with something red.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before they could get at the two men.
One was James Norman Mattock—dead, with the masked
man's bullet through his brain.  Death had wiped the hard
lines from his thin face, taken the prison bitterness out of
his glazing eyes.  It seemed as if a faint, peaceful smile lay
on his lips.
</p>

<p>
Mechanically Inspector Teal doffed his hat in the presence
of death—for the first time in his life.  It was not
because of James Norman Mattock.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Joan—poor kid," he muttered under his breath.
</p>

<p>
And then they turned to the second body.  The black felt
hat had fallen off, and they saw the greying hair which had
once been Saxon yellow.
</p>

<p>
Storm, knowing that the man was dead, turned and
walked slowly away.
</p>

<p>
It was the detective who bent and unfastened the black
silk handkerchief.  And one long, dazed exhalation whistled
through the teeth of Mr. Teal, that bored and placid man.
</p>

<p>
"Great Kippered Herring!" he breathed.  "Lord Hannassay!"
</p>

<p><br><br><br></p>

<p><a id="chap30"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX
<br><br>
TIME!
</h3>

<p>
Four people went back to the Albany that night, and sat
in Kit's snug den smoking and clearing up the odd threads
which remained of the Triangle mystery.  Bill Kennedy;
Inspector Teal, once more phlegmatic and somnolent; Susan,
a trifle pale but very lovely; and—Christopher Arden
Bulsaid, Storm, Lord Hannassay.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Curtain</i>—and an effective tab, too," murmured Storm.
</p>

<p>
His face was considerably damaged, and every limb
ached, but he felt supremely happy.  He smiled.  Between his
bruised lips a cigarette canted skywards at the old
optimistic, devil-may-care angle.
</p>

<p>
"Yeh!  Lord Hannassay the late was the Alpha Triangle.
You all know how he got the bug of revenge in his brain,
and you can all imagine how it grew up till it filled his whole
mind with ideas of making himself a tyrant over all London.
He might've done it, given complete sanity to add to
his genius.  Lombroso'd tell you that wasn't possible.  I hope
Cesare's right—it's lucky for all concerned if he is.
Hannassay couldn't put his scheme into practice till he had
money.  He got that when his father died in India, leaving
him the title and bags of cash.  Then Hannassay got busy.
Created a Mr. Brome, in which <i>rôle</i> he got in touch with the
underworld; and an Oscar Raegenssen to handle the financial
side of the organisation.  Things got a shade too warm
around Lord Hannassay, so we had Fake Death Number
One.  Later on, things began to hum around Siegfried the
Pelican too, so Hannassay trotted out Fake Death Number
Two and just carried on as Snooper.  You can write in most
of the rest for yourselves.  Among other things, you'll be
keen to know why Hannassay fainted when he saw me the
day—night, rather—Morini went gunning for Miss
Hawthorne.  You remember there was only the reading-lamp on
in the library?  The shade was turned up, and the light came
on my face.  He thought he was seeing the ghost of his wife,
Sylvia Mattock, Jimmy's sister.  Hannassay started off his
campaign of revenge by shopping Mattock over a forged
cheque.  Hannassay was rather a brute to my mother, so
when Jimmy came out of stir he had a double grudge to
settle off his own bat.  Hannassay made his second bloomer
when he took Mattock on in Raegenssen's.  His idea was, of
course, to stop him again, since the first shopping hadn't
functioned strong enough.  But Mattock got wise to a thing
or two—one of them was when Raegenssen got in the way
of my auto and spoke with Lord Hannassay's voice.  That
leaves only the Alpha part of it—a bit of supplementary
evidence.  You mayn't know it, but the Greek <i>alpha</i> was
supposed in its original form to represent the head and horns
of an ox.  Bulsaid—<i>bull's head</i>....  Got it?"
</p>

<p>
Storm stretched himself.
</p>

<p>
"And I think that's the complete rehash, according to
Cocker," he remarked after a pause.  "Oh, except for Uncle
Joe."
</p>

<p>
"There's a great detective lost in Uncle Joe," said Teal
sadly.  "D'you know, he cut the wires connecting with the
charge of nitrogen trichloride under Buckingham Palace?
He heard the Apex threatening you with it and crept along
behind the hangings till he found 'em.  Uncle Joe's got
nerve—he'll be able to write a wonderful book after to-night.  By
the way, somebody's going to have a ticklish job digging all
that H.E. out before the ice melts off it," added Mr. Teal
lusciously.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you how I figure it out that Uncle Joe found
the house," said Storm.  "Mattock, I think, must've joined
up in the Triangle, once he got a line on the big boss, in the
hope of finding out enough to put Hannassay in the Awful
Place.  Hannassay'd 've been glad to have him in, as it'd
make shopping him easier.  Matter of fact, Hannassay didn't
go on with that scheme—he was too busy trying to get his
fifteen million thick 'uns out of the Treasury.  Before that,
he'd also got Joan Sands in, to give him a bigger hold over
Mattock than ever.  That was all done through Snooper.
Snooper had the telephone tapped and the bookcase put in,
and told each of 'em separately not to touch it or talk about
it.  Mattock didn't associate Snooper with the Triangle at
that time, or we'd have been saved a lot of trouble, so he
obeyed orders.  God knows why!  Anyway, after the Piccadilly
Circus explosion, Mattock got less dumb.  He put two
and two together and made—Snooper!  So he went chasing
Snooper last night, and Uncle Joe trailed <i>him</i>.  They went
down Buckingham Gate in procession, and all landed up
in the right place.  If we owe something to Uncle Joe, we
owe a darn sight more to Jimmy!  I said he was going to
kill Raegenssen, and, by hookey! he did.  What's happened
to Uncle Joe, by the way?"
</p>

<p>
Teal grimaced.
</p>

<p>
"Last time I saw him, he was rushing round to talk to
Joan.  He's been talking to her and pulling the sympathy
gag nearly all day.  How any man can be so keen on studying
criminology," said Mr. Teal, wilfully dense, "beats me."
</p>

<p>
The four of them had dined together, and the silent-footed
Cork had not long cleared the table and taken his
departure.  The coffee cups in front of them were still
warm, and yet already a subtle restraint had forced itself
into the air.  Two of the guests began to wonder if, even in
that short time, they had not overstayed their welcome.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Assistant Commissioner William Kennedy glared at
Mr. Central Detective-Inspector Teal, and Mr. Teal stared
sombrely back at Mr. Kennedy with sleepy eyes.  Solemnly
each of them nodded to the other.
</p>

<p>
As one man, they rose to their feet.
</p>

<p>
"I've got a lot of work to get through before I can seek
my well-earned rest," said Bill gravely.  "Your own particular
jaunt may be over, but crime goes on for ever."
</p>

<p>
"I," said the drowsy Teal, "have been working all day,
and I'm very tired."
</p>

<p>
In the sacred cause of Accuracy, one must put it on record
that Storm lapsed lamentably from strictly good manners.
He expressed no regret that they could not stay longer, nor
did he beg them to remain.  In fact, he bade them farewell in
haste, as if he were afraid that they might change their
minds.  Only when they were irrevocably hatted and gloved
did he become aware of his duties as a host.
</p>

<p>
"Not even a quick one before you go?" he suggested
half-heartedly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Teal shook his head, shifting his gum to the other
side of his mouth.
</p>

<p>
"It's bad for the heart," he said.  "Fat men didn't ought
to drink...."
</p>

<p>
Storm closed the door and came back into the sitting-room.
He sat on the table, swinging his legs and singing a
little tune.  Deliberately he crushed out the stump of his
cigarette in the ash tray.
</p>

<p>
Susan got up.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose I ought to be going, too," she said.
</p>

<p>
But she did not go.
</p>

<p><br><br></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div><div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
